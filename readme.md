Duality is a decentralized exchange built for capital efficiency, composability and safety from harmful price manipulation. With Duality, liquidity providers and integrating protocols have intuitive, fine grain control over parameters and distribution of their liquidity.

Duality is architected as an IBC-enabled Cosmos-SDK app-chain, and will be launching as an [CosmosHub Interchain Security Zone](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/interchain-security.md) in early 2023. Follow our testnet launch on twitter [@dualityxyz](https://twitter.com/dualityxyz).

For more on Duality's functionality and design read our [documentation](https://app.gitbook.com/o/upl0shA1MRZWWHZNcCvW/s/WV9tVqtA3ykFQ1XFSEw1/concepts).
