The `app` package contains code related to the duality application. Within this package, there is a function called `MakeTestEncodingConfig()`. This function is used to create an `EncodingConfig` object that is used for testing purposes. 

The `EncodingConfig` object is used to configure the encoding and decoding of data structures in the application. It is used to define the encoding and decoding of data structures for different formats such as JSON, Protobuf, and Amino. 

The `MakeTestEncodingConfig()` function is marked as deprecated, which means that it is no longer recommended to use this function. Instead, the `AppCodec` object should be used to create new codecs. 

The function first calls `appparams.MakeTestEncodingConfig()` to create a new `EncodingConfig` object. It then registers the Amino codec and interfaces for the `std` and `ModuleBasics` packages. The `std` package contains standard types used in the Cosmos SDK, while the `ModuleBasics` package contains basic modules for the Cosmos SDK. 

Overall, this function is used to create an `EncodingConfig` object for testing purposes. It is not recommended to use this function in production code, as it is marked as deprecated. Instead, the `AppCodec` object should be used to create new codecs. 

Example usage:

```
import (
    "github.com/duality-labs/duality/app"
    "github.com/tendermint/spm/cosmoscmd"
)

func main() {
    encodingConfig := app.MakeTestEncodingConfig()
    codec := encodingConfig.Marshaler
    // use codec to encode and decode data structures
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a function `MakeTestEncodingConfig` that creates an encoding configuration for testing in the duality app.

2. Why is the `MakeTestEncodingConfig` function marked as deprecated?
   - The function is marked as deprecated because app users should not create new codecs and instead use the `app.AppCodec` provided by the app.

3. What external packages are being imported in this file?
   - This file imports `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/std`, `github.com/duality-labs/duality/app/params`, and `github.com/tendermint/spm/cosmoscmd`.
