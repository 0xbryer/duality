The `proto.go` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/app/params` folder is responsible for creating an `EncodingConfig` for a non-amino based test configuration in the duality project. This is important for testing the project's functionality without relying on amino, a serialization protocol used in Cosmos SDK for encoding and decoding data structures.

The main function in this file is `MakeTestEncodingConfig`, which is used internally in the SDK and should not be used by app users. Instead, app users should use the `app.AppCodec`. This function creates a new legacy amino codec, a new interface registry, and a new proto codec. It then returns an `EncodingConfig` that contains the interface registry, marshaler, TxConfig, and amino codec. The `TxConfig` is created using the new proto codec and the default sign modes.

Here's an example of how this function might be used in the larger project:

```go
import (
    "github.com/duality/params"
)

func main() {
    encodingConfig := params.MakeTestEncodingConfig()
    // use encodingConfig to test project functionality
}
```

In this example, the `MakeTestEncodingConfig` function is called to create an `EncodingConfig` for testing the project's functionality. The resulting `encodingConfig` can then be used to test the project without relying on amino.

In summary, the `proto.go` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/app/params` folder plays a crucial role in creating a non-amino based test configuration for the duality project. This allows developers to test the project's functionality without depending on amino, ensuring that the project works correctly with different serialization protocols. The `MakeTestEncodingConfig` function is the key component in this file, and it is used to create the necessary `EncodingConfig` for testing purposes.
