The code in this file is responsible for creating an EncodingConfig for a non-amino based test configuration in the duality project. The MakeTestEncodingConfig function is used internally in the SDK and should not be used by app users. Instead, app users should use the app.AppCodec.

The MakeTestEncodingConfig function creates a new legacy amino codec, a new interface registry, and a new proto codec. It then returns an EncodingConfig that contains the interface registry, marshaler, TxConfig, and amino codec. The TxConfig is created using the new proto codec and the default sign modes.

This function is used to create a test configuration for the duality project that does not use amino. Amino is a serialization protocol used in Cosmos SDK, and it is used to encode and decode data structures in the project. By creating a non-amino based test configuration, the developers can test the project's functionality without relying on amino.

Here is an example of how this function might be used in the larger project:

```
import (
    "github.com/duality/params"
)

func main() {
    encodingConfig := params.MakeTestEncodingConfig()
    // use encodingConfig to test project functionality
}
```

In this example, the MakeTestEncodingConfig function is called to create an EncodingConfig for testing the project's functionality. The resulting encodingConfig can then be used to test the project without relying on amino.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this file within the `duality` project?
- This file is located in the `params` package and contains a function for creating an encoding configuration for non-amino based tests.

2. What is the difference between `codec` and `types` packages imported in this file?
- The `codec` package is used for encoding and decoding data, while the `types` package is used for registering interfaces for use with the `codec` package.

3. Why is the `MakeTestEncodingConfig` function marked as deprecated?
- The function is marked as deprecated because app users should not create new codecs and should instead use the `AppCodec` provided by the app.
