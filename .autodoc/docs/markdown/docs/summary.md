The `docs.go` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/docs` folder is responsible for embedding a directory called "static" into the binary of the duality project. This is achieved using the `embed` package, which provides the `embed.FS` type, a file system that can be used to access the contents of the embedded directory.

Embedding the "static" directory simplifies the distribution of the duality project, as it can be included in the binary itself. This eliminates the need to distribute the directory separately and ensures the project can be deployed on different machines without worrying about the presence of the "static" directory.

The `//go:embed` directive is a special comment that instructs the Go compiler to include the specified files or directories in the binary. In this case, the `static` directory is being included.

To access the contents of the embedded directory, the `Docs` variable can be used. For example, if there is a file called "index.html" in the "static" directory, it can be accessed like this:

```go
data, err := Docs.ReadFile("static/index.html")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
// use data
```

This code reads the contents of the "index.html" file into the `data` variable. If there is an error reading the file, it is handled appropriately. The `data` variable can then be used as needed.

In the context of the larger duality project, this code plays a crucial role in simplifying the distribution and deployment process. By embedding the "static" directory in the binary, the project can be deployed on different machines without having to worry about whether the directory is present or not. This can be particularly useful when working with other parts of the project that rely on the contents of the "static" directory, as they can access the embedded files using the `Docs` variable.
