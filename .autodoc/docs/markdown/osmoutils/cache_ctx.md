The `osmoutils` package contains a function called `ApplyFuncIfNoError` and two helper functions called `IsOutOfGasError` and `PrintPanicRecoveryError`. 

The `ApplyFuncIfNoError` function takes two arguments: a `sdk.Context` and a function `f` that takes a `sdk.Context` and returns an error. The purpose of this function is to execute the function `f` within a cache context. If there is an error or panic, the state machine change is dropped and the error is logged. If there is no error, the output of `f` is written to the cache context and the events are emitted. This function is useful for executing functions that modify the state of the application, such as transactions. 

The `IsOutOfGasError` function takes an argument `err` of type `any` and returns a boolean and a string. This function is used to determine if an error is an out of gas error. If the error is an out of gas error, the function returns `true` and the error descriptor. If the error is not an out of gas error, the function returns `false` and an empty string. 

The `PrintPanicRecoveryError` function takes two arguments: a `sdk.Context` and a `recoveryError` of type `interface{}`. The purpose of this function is to log the recovery error and the stack trace. If the recovery error is an out of gas error, the error is logged as a debug message. If the recovery error is a string, runtime error, or error, the error is logged as an error message. If the recovery error is of any other type, the error is logged as a default panic message and the stack trace is printed to stdout. 

Overall, these functions are used to handle errors and panics that may occur during the execution of functions that modify the state of the application. The `ApplyFuncIfNoError` function provides a way to execute these functions within a cache context and handle any errors or panics that may occur. The `IsOutOfGasError` and `PrintPanicRecoveryError` functions are helper functions that are used to determine if an error is an out of gas error and log any errors or panics that occur.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ApplyFuncIfNoError` function?
- The `ApplyFuncIfNoError` function allows a function `f` to be executed within a new cache context, and if there is no error, the output of `f` is written to the state machine. If there is an error or panic, the state machine change is dropped and the error is logged.

2. What is the purpose of the `IsOutOfGasError` function?
- The `IsOutOfGasError` function checks if an error is an out of gas error, and returns a boolean indicating whether it is, as well as a string descriptor of the error.

3. What does the `PrintPanicRecoveryError` function do?
- The `PrintPanicRecoveryError` function logs the recovery error and stack trace if it can be parsed, and emits them to stdout if not. It handles different types of panic errors, including out of gas errors.
