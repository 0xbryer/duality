The `osmocli` package contains code that provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the Osmocom cellular network stack. The code in this file defines several types and functions that are used to parse and handle command-line flags.

The `FlagAdvice` type is a struct that contains advice on how to handle command-line flags. It has several fields that are used to customize the behavior of the CLI. For example, the `HasPagination` field is a boolean that indicates whether the CLI should paginate its output. The `CustomFlagOverrides` field is a map that allows users to override the default flag names with custom names. The `CustomFieldParsers` field is a map that allows users to define custom parsers for command-line flags.

The `FlagDesc` type is a struct that describes the flags that should be added to a command. It has two fields: `RequiredFlags` and `OptionalFlags`. These fields are arrays of `pflag.FlagSet` objects, which represent sets of command-line flags.

The `AddFlags` function takes a `cobra.Command` object and a `FlagDesc` object as arguments. It adds the flags described in the `FlagDesc` object to the `cobra.Command` object. If a flag is marked as required, the function also marks it as required in the `cobra.Command` object.

The `Sanitize` method is a method on the `FlagAdvice` type that sanitizes the `CustomFlagOverrides` and `CustomFieldParsers` fields. It converts all keys to lowercase and initializes the fields if they are uninitialized.

The `FlagOnlyParser` function is a function that takes a function that returns a value of any type and returns a `CustomFieldParserFn`. This function is used to create custom parsers for command-line flags.

Overall, this code provides a flexible and extensible way to handle command-line flags in the Osmocom CLI. It allows users to customize the behavior of the CLI by defining custom flag names and parsers. It also provides a way to mark flags as required, which helps ensure that users provide all necessary input.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FlagAdvice` struct and its fields?
- The `FlagAdvice` struct contains fields that provide advice on how to handle flags for a command, including whether pagination is needed, custom flag overrides, custom field parsers, and transaction sender information.

2. What is the purpose of the `AddFlags` function?
- The `AddFlags` function adds flag sets to a given `cobra.Command` instance, marking required flags as required.

3. What is the purpose of the `Sanitize` method on the `FlagAdvice` struct?
- The `Sanitize` method maps the keys of `CustomFlagOverrides` and `CustomFieldParsers` to lowercase and initializes them if they are uninitialized.
