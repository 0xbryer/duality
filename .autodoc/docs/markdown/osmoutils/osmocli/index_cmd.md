The `osmocli` package contains code for a command-line interface (CLI) tool that interacts with an Osmocom cellular network. This specific file contains two functions: `IndexCmd` and `indexRunCmd`.

The `IndexCmd` function takes in a `moduleName` string and returns a `cobra.Command` object. This object represents a CLI command that can be executed by the user. The `Use` field of the command is set to the `moduleName` parameter, which is the name of the module being queried. The `Short` field is set to a formatted string that describes the purpose of the command. The `DisableFlagParsing` field is set to `true`, which means that any flags passed to the command will not be parsed. The `SuggestionsMinimumDistance` field is set to `2`, which means that the CLI will suggest commands that are at most two characters different from the user's input. Finally, the `RunE` field is set to the `indexRunCmd` function, which will be executed when the command is run.

The `indexRunCmd` function takes in a `cobra.Command` object and a slice of strings as arguments. It sets a custom usage template for the command using the `SetUsageTemplate` method of the `cmd` object. The template is a string that defines how the command's usage information will be displayed to the user. The function then calls the `Help` method of the `cmd` object, which prints the usage information to the console.

Overall, this code defines a CLI command that can be used to query information about a specific module in an Osmocom cellular network. The `IndexCmd` function creates the command object, and the `indexRunCmd` function sets a custom usage template and prints the usage information to the console. This code can be used as a building block for a larger CLI tool that interacts with an Osmocom network. An example of how this code might be used is shown below:

```
package main

import (
	"os"

	"github.com/spf13/cobra"
	"github.com/osmocom/duality/osmocli"
)

func main() {
	rootCmd := &cobra.Command{
		Use: "duality",
	}

	moduleCmd := osmocli.IndexCmd("module_name")
	rootCmd.AddCommand(moduleCmd)

	if err := rootCmd.Execute(); err != nil {
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```

In this example, a root command is created with the name "duality". The `IndexCmd` function is called with the parameter "module_name", which creates a CLI command that can be used to query information about the "module_name" module. The `moduleCmd` object is added as a subcommand of the root command using the `AddCommand` method. Finally, the `Execute` method is called on the root command, which runs the CLI tool and waits for user input. When the user enters the `module_name` command, the `indexRunCmd` function is executed, which prints the usage information to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IndexCmd` function?
- The `IndexCmd` function returns a `cobra.Command` that is used to query commands for a specific module.

2. What is the significance of `DisableFlagParsing` being set to true?
- Setting `DisableFlagParsing` to true disables the parsing of flags for the command, which means that any flags passed to the command will be ignored.

3. What is the purpose of the `usageTemplate` variable in the `indexRunCmd` function?
- The `usageTemplate` variable is a string that defines the usage template for the command. It is used to generate the usage message that is displayed when the `--help` flag is passed to the command.
