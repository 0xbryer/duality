The `osmocli` package contains code for building CLI commands for interacting with a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain. The `TxIndexCmd` function returns a Cobra command that is used to index transactions for a given module. The `TxCliDesc` struct defines the properties of a transaction command, including its use, short and long descriptions, number of arguments, and a function for parsing and building a message. The `AddTxCmd` function adds a transaction command to a given Cobra command, and the `BuildTxCli` function builds a Cobra command from a `TxCliDesc` struct. The `BuildCommandCustomFn` method builds a Cobra command from a `TxCliDesc` struct with custom flag overrides and field parsers.

Overall, this code provides a framework for building CLI commands for interacting with a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain. It allows developers to easily define the properties of a transaction command and build a Cobra command from those properties. This code is likely used in the larger project to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the blockchain via the command line. Here is an example of how this code might be used to build a transaction command:

```
desc := &TxCliDesc{
    Use: "mytx",
    Short: "My custom transaction command",
    Long: "This command does something cool",
    NumArgs: 2,
    ParseAndBuildMsg: func(clientCtx client.Context, args []string, flags *pflag.FlagSet) (sdk.Msg, error) {
        // Parse arguments and build a message
    },
    TxSignerFieldName: "from",
    Flags: FlagDesc{
        {"flag1", "", "Flag 1", true},
        {"flag2", "", "Flag 2", true},
    },
}
cmd := desc.BuildCommandCustomFn()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TxIndexCmd` function?
- The `TxIndexCmd` function returns a Cobra command that is used to index transactions for a given module.

2. What is the purpose of the `TxCliDesc` struct?
- The `TxCliDesc` struct is used to describe a CLI command for a transaction message. It includes information such as the command name, description, number of arguments, and a function to parse and build the message.

3. What is the purpose of the `AddTxCmd` function?
- The `AddTxCmd` function adds a new Cobra command to an existing command with the given transaction message and CLI description.
