The `osmoutils` package in the `.autodoc/docs/json/osmoutils` folder provides utility functions that can be used throughout the `duality` project to handle errors, create new instances of types, and manipulate slices. 

The `cache_ctx.go` file contains the `ApplyFuncIfNoError` function, which is used to execute a function `f` within a cache context. This is useful for executing functions that modify the state of the application, such as transactions. If there is an error or panic, the state machine change is dropped and the error is logged. The `IsOutOfGasError` and `PrintPanicRecoveryError` functions are helper functions that determine if an error is an out of gas error and log any errors or panics that occur.

The `generic_helper.go` file contains the `MakeNew` function, which creates a new instance of a generic type `T`. This function can be used in various scenarios where dynamic creation of new instances of a type is required, such as in a factory pattern. Here's an example of how to use `MakeNew`:

```go
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age int
}

func main() {
    p := MakeNew[Person]()
    p.Name = "John"
    p.Age = 30
    fmt.Println(p) // prints "{John 30}"
}
```

The `slice_helper.go` file contains utility functions for manipulating and analyzing slices, such as `SortSlice`, `Filter`, `ReverseSlice`, and `ContainsDuplicate`. These functions can be used throughout the `duality` project to work with slices of various types. Here's an example of how to use `Filter`:

```go
import "osmoutils"

numbers := []int{3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3}
evenNumbers := osmoutils.Filter(func(n int) bool {
    return n%2 == 0
}, numbers)
fmt.Println(evenNumbers) // Output: [4 2 6]
```

In summary, the `osmoutils` package provides a set of utility functions that can be used throughout the `duality` project to handle errors, create new instances of types, and manipulate slices. These functions help improve code reusability and maintainability within the project.
