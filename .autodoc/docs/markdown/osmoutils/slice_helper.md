The `osmoutils` package contains several utility functions that can be used in the larger `duality` project. 

The `SortSlice` function takes a slice of type `T` and sorts it in ascending order. The type `T` must implement the `constraints.Ordered` interface, which means that it must have a defined order. This function mutates the input slice `s`. Here is an example of how to use this function:

```
import "osmoutils"

numbers := []int{3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3}
osmoutils.SortSlice(numbers)
fmt.Println(numbers) // Output: [1 1 2 3 3 4 5 5 6 9]
```

The `Filter` function takes a slice of type `T` and a filter function that takes an element of type `T` and returns a boolean. It returns a new slice that contains only the elements that pass the filter. Here is an example of how to use this function:

```
import "osmoutils"

numbers := []int{3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3}
evenNumbers := osmoutils.Filter(func(n int) bool {
    return n%2 == 0
}, numbers)
fmt.Println(evenNumbers) // Output: [4 2 6]
```

The `ReverseSlice` function takes a slice of any type `T` and reverses it in place. This function mutates the input slice `s`. Here is an example of how to use this function:

```
import "osmoutils"

numbers := []int{3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3}
osmoutils.ReverseSlice(numbers)
fmt.Println(numbers) // Output: [3 5 6 2 9 5 1 4 1 3]
```

The `ContainsDuplicate` function takes a slice of any type `T` and checks if there are any duplicate elements in the slice. It returns a boolean indicating whether there are duplicates or not. Here is an example of how to use this function:

```
import "osmoutils"

numbers := []int{3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3}
hasDuplicates := osmoutils.ContainsDuplicate(numbers)
fmt.Println(hasDuplicates) // Output: true
``` 

Overall, these utility functions can be used to manipulate and analyze slices of various types in the `duality` project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `constraints` package imported from `golang.org/x/exp`?
- The `constraints` package is used to specify constraints on generic types.

2. What is the purpose of the `Filter` function?
- The `Filter` function takes a slice and a filter function as input, and returns a new slice containing only the elements that pass the filter function.

3. What is the time complexity of the `ContainsDuplicate` function?
- The time complexity of the `ContainsDuplicate` function is O(n), where n is the length of the input slice.
