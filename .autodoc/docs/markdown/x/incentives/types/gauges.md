The `types` package in the `duality` project contains a type definition and two methods for working with a collection of `Gauge` objects. The `Gauges` type is defined as a slice of pointers to `Gauge` objects. 

The first method, `GetCoinsDistributed()`, takes no arguments and returns a `sdk.Coins` object. This method iterates over each `Gauge` object in the `Gauges` slice and adds the `DistributedCoins` field of each `Gauge` to the `result` object. The `DistributedCoins` field is a `sdk.Coins` object that represents the amount of coins that have already been distributed from the `Gauge`. Therefore, the `GetCoinsDistributed()` method returns the total amount of coins that have been distributed across all `Gauge` objects in the `Gauges` slice.

The second method, `GetCoinsRemaining()`, also takes no arguments and returns a `sdk.Coins` object. This method iterates over each `Gauge` object in the `Gauges` slice and adds the result of calling the `CoinsRemaining()` method of each `Gauge` to the `result` object. The `CoinsRemaining()` method of the `Gauge` type returns a `sdk.Coins` object that represents the amount of coins that have not yet been distributed from the `Gauge`. Therefore, the `GetCoinsRemaining()` method returns the total amount of coins that have not yet been distributed across all `Gauge` objects in the `Gauges` slice.

These methods are useful for tracking the distribution of coins across multiple `Gauge` objects in the `duality` project. For example, if the `Gauges` slice represents a set of liquidity gauges for a decentralized exchange, the `GetCoinsDistributed()` method could be used to determine the total amount of liquidity that has been provided to the exchange, while the `GetCoinsRemaining()` method could be used to determine the total amount of liquidity that is still available for users to provide. 

Example usage:

```
// create a slice of Gauge objects
gauges := []*Gauge{gauge1, gauge2, gauge3}

// get the total amount of coins distributed across all gauges
distributedCoins := gauges.GetCoinsDistributed()

// get the total amount of coins remaining across all gauges
remainingCoins := gauges.GetCoinsRemaining()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `types` package in this project?
- The `types` package contains type definitions used throughout the `duality` project.

2. What is the `Gauges` type and how is it used?
- `Gauges` is a slice of pointers to `Gauge` objects. It is used to represent a collection of gauges and has methods to retrieve information about the coins distributed and remaining from those gauges.

3. What is the difference between the `GetCoinsDistributed` and `GetCoinsRemaining` methods?
- `GetCoinsDistributed` returns the total amount of coins that have been distributed across all gauges in the collection, while `GetCoinsRemaining` returns the total amount of coins that have not yet been distributed across all gauges in the collection.
