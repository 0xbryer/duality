The `types` package contains message types and related functions for the `duality` project. The package defines several message types, including `MsgCreateGauge`, `MsgAddToGauge`, `MsgStake`, and `MsgUnstake`, each with its own set of functions.

The `MsgCreateGauge` type represents a message to create a gauge with the provided parameters. The `NewMsgCreateGauge` function creates a new `MsgCreateGauge` message with the specified parameters. The `ValidateBasic` function checks that the message is valid, and the `GetSignBytes` and `GetSigners` functions return the byte array and owner, respectively, for the message.

The `MsgAddToGauge` type represents a message to add rewards to a specific gauge. The `NewMsgAddToGauge` function creates a new `MsgAddToGauge` message with the specified parameters. The `ValidateBasic` function checks that the message is valid, and the `GetSignBytes` and `GetSigners` functions return the byte array and owner, respectively, for the message.

The `MsgStake` type represents a message to stake tokens. The `NewMsgStakeTokens` function creates a new `MsgStake` message with the specified parameters. The `ValidateBasic` function checks that the message is valid, and the `GetSignBytes` and `GetSigners` functions return the byte array and owner, respectively, for the message.

The `MsgUnstake` type represents a message to unstake the tokens of a set of stake records. The `NewMsgUnstake` function creates a new `MsgUnstake` message with the specified parameters. The `ValidateBasic` function checks that the message is valid, and the `GetSignBytes` and `GetSigners` functions return the byte array and owner, respectively, for the message.

Overall, this package provides the message types and functions necessary for creating, adding to, staking, and unstaking gauges in the `duality` project. These messages can be used to interact with the project's smart contracts and blockchain. For example, a user could create a new gauge by calling the `NewMsgCreateGauge` function with the desired parameters, and then submitting the resulting message to the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What are the different types of messages that can be created in this package?
- There are six different types of messages that can be created in this package: `create_gauge`, `add_to_gauge`, `stake_tokens`, `begin_unstaking_all`, `begin_unstaking`, and `edit_stakeup`.

2. What is the purpose of the `NewMsgCreateGauge` function?
- The `NewMsgCreateGauge` function creates a message to create a gauge with the provided parameters.

3. What is the purpose of the `MsgUnstake` message and its associated functions?
- The `MsgUnstake` message is used to unstake the tokens of a set of stake records. Its associated functions include `NewMsgUnstake` to create the message, `ValidateBasic` to check that the message is valid, `GetSignBytes` to turn the message into a byte array, and `GetSigners` to return the owner in a byte array.
