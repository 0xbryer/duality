This code is a reverse proxy that translates gRPC into RESTful JSON APIs for the duality project. It is auto-generated by the `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway` tool and should not be edited manually. The code is part of the `types` package and provides a set of functions to handle HTTP requests and forward them to the appropriate gRPC methods.

The main functionality is provided by the `RegisterQueryHandlerClient` function, which registers the HTTP handlers for the `Query` service. These handlers forward requests to the gRPC endpoint over the given implementation of `QueryClient`. The code also provides alternative registration functions, such as `RegisterQueryHandlerServer` and `RegisterQueryHandlerFromEndpoint`, which register the handlers with different configurations.

The code defines several patterns for handling different types of requests, such as getting module status, gauge information, stakes, and future reward estimates. For each pattern, there are two functions: one for handling the request locally (`local_request_*`) and one for forwarding the request to a remote server (`request_*`). These functions parse the request, extract the required parameters, and call the appropriate gRPC methods.

For example, the `request_Query_GetGaugeByID_0` function handles requests for getting gauge information by ID. It extracts the "id" parameter from the request, converts it to the appropriate data type, and calls the `GetGaugeByID` method on the `QueryClient`. The response is then returned to the caller.

In summary, this code provides a set of HTTP handlers that translate RESTful JSON API requests into gRPC calls for the duality project. It enables users to interact with the project using familiar HTTP methods and JSON data, while still benefiting from the performance and features of gRPC.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `duality/incentives/query.proto` file in this project?
   **Answer**: The `duality/incentives/query.proto` file defines the gRPC service and messages for querying incentives-related data in the Duality project. This file is used to generate the gRPC and RESTful JSON API code for the service.

2. **Question**: What are the main functions provided by the `types` package in this code?
   **Answer**: The `types` package provides functions for handling HTTP requests and forwarding them to the appropriate gRPC methods. It includes functions for handling requests related to module status, gauges, stakes, and future reward estimates.

3. **Question**: How does the code handle the conversion between gRPC and RESTful JSON APIs?
   **Answer**: The code uses the `grpc-gateway` library to handle the conversion between gRPC and RESTful JSON APIs. It defines functions for each gRPC method that take an HTTP request, extract the necessary parameters, and call the corresponding gRPC method. The response from the gRPC method is then converted back to a JSON format and sent as an HTTP response.
