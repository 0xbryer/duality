The `incentives` module provides a general interface to give yield to stakers. The yield to be given to stakers is stored in gauges and is distributed on an epoch basis to the stakers who meet specific conditions. The module provides functionalities for gauge queries, gauge creation, and adding tokens to gauges. It also provides functionalities for upcoming-gauges related queries, gauge infos, and gauge queues.

The `AppModuleBasic` struct implements the `AppModuleBasic` interface for the module. It provides functionalities for registering the module's types on the LegacyAmino codec, registering the module's interface types, returning the module's default genesis state, validating the genesis state, registering the module's REST service handlers, registering the gRPC Gateway routes for the module, returning the module's root tx command, and returning the module's root query command.

The `AppModule` struct implements the `AppModule` interface for the module. It provides functionalities for registering the module's services, registering the module's invariants, performing the module's genesis initialization, exporting the module's genesis state as raw JSON bytes, executing all ABCI BeginBlock logic respective to the module, executing all ABCI EndBlock logic respective to the module, generating a randomized GenState of the incentives module, returning nil for governance proposals contents, returning nil for randomized parameters, and registering the store decoder.

The `incentives` module can be used in the larger project to incentivize stakers to participate in the network by providing them with yield. The module can be used to create and manage gauges, which store the yield to be distributed to stakers. The module can also be used to query gauge information and upcoming gauges. The functionalities provided by the module can be accessed through the CLI or REST service handlers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `incentives` module and how does it work?
- The `incentives` module provides an interface for giving yield to stakers stored in gauges and distributed on an epoch basis to stakers who meet specific conditions.
2. What external dependencies does this module have?
- This module imports several packages from the `cosmos-sdk` and `tendermint` libraries, as well as `gorilla/mux` and `grpc-gateway/runtime`.
3. What are the functions of the `AppModuleBasic` and `AppModule` structs?
- The `AppModuleBasic` struct implements the `AppModuleBasic` interface for the module, while the `AppModule` struct implements the `AppModule` interface for the module and contains the module's keeper, accountKeeper, bankKeeper, and epochKeeper.
