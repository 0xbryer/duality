This code is a part of the duality project and is located in the `keeper` package. The purpose of this code is to define hooks that are called before and after each epoch in the duality blockchain. These hooks are used to perform certain actions at the start and end of each epoch. 

The `BeforeEpochStart` hook is called at the start of each epoch and takes in the epoch identifier and epoch number as arguments. In this code, the `BeforeEpochStart` function simply returns nil, indicating that no action needs to be taken at the start of the epoch.

The `AfterEpochEnd` hook is called at the end of each epoch and takes in the epoch identifier and epoch number as arguments. In this code, the `AfterEpochEnd` function performs several actions related to distributing rewards to users. First, it checks if the current epoch is the distribution epoch specified in the parameters. If it is, it retrieves the upcoming gauges and checks if any of them are active. If an upcoming gauge is active, it is moved to the active gauges list. Next, it retrieves the active gauges and filters out any perpetual gauges. The remaining gauges are then used to distribute rewards to users. 

The `Hooks` struct is a wrapper for the `Keeper` struct and implements the `EpochHooks` interface. The `Hooks` struct has two methods, `BeforeEpochStart` and `AfterEpochEnd`, which simply call the corresponding methods in the `Keeper` struct. 

Overall, this code is used to define hooks that are called at the start and end of each epoch in the duality blockchain. These hooks are used to perform actions related to distributing rewards to users. The `BeforeEpochStart` hook does not perform any actions, while the `AfterEpochEnd` hook retrieves and distributes rewards to users based on the active gauges. 

Example usage:
```
// create a new keeper
k := NewKeeper()

// get the hooks for the keeper
hooks := k.Hooks()

// register the hooks with the epoch module
epochModule.RegisterEpochHooks(hooks)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code defines the `BeforeEpochStart` and `AfterEpochEnd` hooks for the `incentives` module of the `duality` project. The `AfterEpochEnd` hook distributes rewards to active gauges at the end of an epoch.

2. What other modules or packages does this code import?
   
   This code imports `github.com/duality-labs/duality/x/epochs/types`, `github.com/duality-labs/duality/x/incentives/types`, and `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types`.

3. What is the relationship between the `BeforeEpochStart` and `AfterEpochEnd` functions defined in this code and the `EpochHooks` interface defined in `github.com/duality-labs/duality/x/epochs/types`?
   
   The `BeforeEpochStart` and `AfterEpochEnd` functions defined in this code implement the `BeforeEpochStart` and `AfterEpochEnd` functions of the `EpochHooks` interface defined in `github.com/duality-labs/duality/x/epochs/types`. The `Hooks` struct defined in this code is used to wrap the `Keeper` and provide the implementation of the `EpochHooks` interface.
