The `keeper` package contains functions that handle the storage and retrieval of data related to incentives and staking in the Duality project. The `addStakeRefs` and `deleteStakeRefs` functions are used to add and delete reference keys for a given stake. These reference keys are used to track the staked assets and calculate the incentives that should be rewarded to the staker.

The `addStakeRefs` function takes a stake object as input and adds appropriate reference keys to the storage. The reference keys are created based on the stake object's owner, staked coins, and start time. The function first calls the `getStakeRefKeys` function to get the reference keys for the stake object. It then iterates over the reference keys and adds them to the storage using the `addRefByKey` function. The `addRefByKey` function is not defined in this file, but it is likely defined in another file in the `keeper` package.

The `deleteStakeRefs` function is similar to the `addStakeRefs` function, but it deletes the reference keys for a given stake object instead of adding them. It first calls the `getStakeRefKeys` function to get the reference keys for the stake object. It then iterates over the reference keys and deletes them from the storage using the `deleteRefByKey` function. The `deleteRefByKey` function is not defined in this file, but it is likely defined in another file in the `keeper` package.

The `getStakeRefKeys` function is used by both `addStakeRefs` and `deleteStakeRefs` functions to generate the reference keys for a given stake object. The function takes a stake object as input and returns a slice of byte slices representing the reference keys. The function first converts the stake object's owner address from a Bech32 string to a byte slice using the `sdk.AccAddressFromBech32` function. It then creates a slice of byte slices representing the reference keys based on the staked coins and start time. The reference keys are created using the `CombineKeys` function, which concatenates the input byte slices with a separator byte. The reference keys are then returned as a slice of byte slices.

Overall, these functions are used to manage the reference keys for staked assets in the Duality project. They are likely used in conjunction with other functions in the `keeper` package to calculate and distribute incentives to stakers. Here is an example of how the `addStakeRefs` function might be used in the larger project:

```
// create a new stake object
stake := types.Stake{
    ID:        "1",
    Owner:     "cosmos1abc...",
    Coins:     sdk.NewCoins(sdk.NewCoin("abc", sdk.NewInt(100))),
    StartTime: time.Now(),
}

// add the reference keys for the stake object
err := keeper.addStakeRefs(ctx, &stake)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `addStakeRefs` and `deleteStakeRefs` functions?
   - These functions add and delete reference keys for a stake, respectively. The reference keys are used to keep track of the stake in various contexts.
2. What is the `getStakeRefKeys` function doing?
   - This function generates a list of reference keys for a given stake. The keys are used to index the stake in various contexts.
3. What external packages are being imported in this file?
   - This file imports `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types`, `github.com/duality-labs/duality/x/dex/types`, and `github.com/duality-labs/duality/x/incentives/types`.
