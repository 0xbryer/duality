The `Keeper` struct in the `keeper` package provides a way to manage the storage of the incentives module in the duality project. The `Keeper` struct has several fields, including `storeKey`, `paramSpace`, `hooks`, `ak`, `bk`, `ek`, `dk`, and `distributor`. 

The `storeKey` field is of type `sdk.StoreKey` and is used to access the module's data in the application's main store. The `paramSpace` field is of type `paramtypes.Subspace` and is used to manage the module's parameters. The `hooks` field is of type `types.IncentiveHooks` and is used to manage the module's hooks. The `ak` field is of type `types.AccountKeeper` and is used to manage accounts in the application. The `bk` field is of type `types.BankKeeper` and is used to manage the application's bank. The `ek` field is of type `types.EpochKeeper` and is used to manage epochs in the application. The `dk` field is of type `types.DexKeeper` and is used to manage the application's decentralized exchange. Finally, the `distributor` field is of type `Distributor` and is used to manage the distribution of incentives.

The `NewKeeper` function returns a new instance of the `Keeper` struct. It takes in several parameters, including `storeKey`, `paramSpace`, `ak`, `bk`, `ek`, and `dk`. If the `paramSpace` parameter does not have a key table, it is set to the key table of the `types` package. The function then creates a new `Keeper` struct with the given parameters and sets the `distributor` field to a new instance of the `Distributor` struct.

The `SetHooks` function sets the incentives hooks for the `Keeper` struct. It takes in an `ih` parameter of type `types.IncentiveHooks`. If the `hooks` field is not `nil`, the function panics. Otherwise, the `hooks` field is set to the given `ih` parameter.

The `Logger` function returns a logger instance for the incentives module. It takes in a `ctx` parameter of type `sdk.Context` and returns a logger instance with the module name set to `"x/incentives"`.

The `GetModuleBalance` function returns the full balance of the module. It takes in a `ctx` parameter of type `sdk.Context` and returns the balance of the module's account.

The `GetModuleStakedCoins` function returns the staked balance of the module. It takes in a `ctx` parameter of type `sdk.Context` and returns the staked balance of the module's account.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Keeper` struct and what are its dependencies?
- The `Keeper` struct provides a way to manage incentives module storage and depends on several other types including `AccountKeeper`, `BankKeeper`, `EpochKeeper`, `DexKeeper`, and `Distributor`.
2. What is the purpose of the `NewKeeper` function and what does it return?
- The `NewKeeper` function returns a new instance of the `Keeper` struct and takes several arguments including a `StoreKey`, `Subspace`, and several other dependencies.
3. What is the purpose of the `GetModuleStakedCoins` function and how does it work?
- The `GetModuleStakedCoins` function returns the staked balance of the module by getting all not unstaking and not finished unstaking stakes using the `GetStakes` function.
