The `keeper` package contains functions for managing references to objects in the `duality` project. The package provides methods for adding, deleting, and retrieving references to objects using Cosmos SDK's `KVStore`.

The `findIndex` function takes an array of IDs and a specific ID, then returns the index of the specific ID in the array. If the ID is not found, it returns -1.

The `removeValue` function takes an array of IDs and a specific ID, then finds the index of the ID in the array and removes it. It returns the updated array and the index of the removed ID. If the ID is not found, it returns the original array and -1.

The `getRefs` method takes a context and a key, then retrieves the IDs associated with the key from the KVStore. It returns an array of IDs.

The `addRefByKey` method takes a context, a key, and an ID, then appends the ID to the array associated with the key in the KVStore. It first retrieves the existing IDs associated with the key, checks if the ID already exists in the array, and returns an error if it does. If the ID does not exist, it appends the ID to the array and stores the updated array in the KVStore.

The `deleteRefByKey` method takes a context, a key, and an ID, then removes the ID from the array associated with the key in the KVStore. It first retrieves the existing IDs associated with the key, removes the ID from the array, and returns an error if the ID is not found. If the ID is found and removed, it updates the array in the KVStore. If the array is empty after the ID is removed, it deletes the key from the KVStore.

These functions and methods can be used to manage references to objects in the `duality` project. For example, `addRefByKey` can be used to add a reference to an object when it is created, and `deleteRefByKey` can be used to remove the reference when the object is deleted. The `getRefs` method can be used to retrieve all references associated with a specific key.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Keeper` type and where is it defined?
- The `Keeper` type is used in the `getRefs`, `addRefByKey`, and `deleteRefByKey` functions to interact with the key-value store. It is likely defined in another file within the `duality` project.

2. What is the expected format of the `key` parameter in the `getRefs`, `addRefByKey`, and `deleteRefByKey` functions?
- The `key` parameter is expected to be a byte slice that is used to identify the array of IDs associated with a particular object.

3. What happens if an error occurs during JSON unmarshaling in the `getRefs` function?
- If an error occurs during JSON unmarshaling, the function will panic.
