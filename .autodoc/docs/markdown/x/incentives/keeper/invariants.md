The `keeper` package contains two functions that register and execute invariants for the `duality` project's governance module. 

The `RegisterInvariants` function registers two invariants: `AccumulationStoreInvariant` and `StakesBalancesInvariant`. These invariants are used to ensure that the sum of all stakes at a given duration is equal to the value stored within the accumulation store and that the module balance and the sum of all tokens within all stakes have the equivalent amount of tokens, respectively. 

The `AccumulationStoreInvariant` function checks the sum of all stakes at different durations against the value stored within the accumulation store. It does this by first getting the module account and all balances associated with it. It then loops through all denoms on the stakeup module and checks the sum of all stakes at different durations against the value stored within the accumulation store. If the sum of all stakes at a given duration is not equal to the value stored within the accumulation store, an error message is returned. 

The `StakesBalancesInvariant` function checks that the module balance and the sum of all tokens within all stakes have the equivalent amount of tokens. It does this by first getting the module account and all balances associated with it. It then loops through all denoms on the stakeup module and checks that the sum of all tokens within all stakes is equal to the module balance. If the sum of all tokens within all stakes is not equal to the module balance, an error message is returned.

These functions are important for ensuring the integrity of the `duality` project's governance module. They can be used to detect and prevent errors in the system, which could lead to incorrect calculations or other issues. 

Example usage of these functions would involve calling `RegisterInvariants` during the initialization of the governance module and then periodically executing the registered invariants to ensure that the system is functioning correctly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RegisterInvariants` function?
   - The `RegisterInvariants` function registers governance invariants for the `duality` project.
2. What does the `AccumulationStoreInvariant` function do?
   - The `AccumulationStoreInvariant` function ensures that the sum of all stakes at a given duration is equal to the value stored within the accumulation store.
3. What is the purpose of the `StakesBalancesInvariant` function?
   - The `StakesBalancesInvariant` function ensures that the module balance and the sum of all tokens within all stakes have the equivalent amount of tokens.
