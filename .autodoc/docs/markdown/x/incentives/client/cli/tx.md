The `cli` package contains the command-line interface (CLI) for the incentives module of the Duality project. The CLI allows users to interact with the incentives module by creating gauges, adding to gauges, staking tokens, and unstaking tokens. 

The `GetTxCmd` function returns a `cobra.Command` that includes all the transaction commands for the incentives module. The `AddTxCmd` function is used to add each of the four transaction commands to the `cobra.Command`. 

The `NewCreateGaugeCmd` function returns a `osmocli.TxCliDesc` and a `types.MsgCreateGauge`. The `osmocli.TxCliDesc` contains information about the command, such as the use case, short and long descriptions, and examples. The `types.MsgCreateGauge` is a message that is sent to the blockchain to create a new gauge. The `CreateGaugeCmdBuilder` function is used to parse the command-line arguments and flags and build the `types.MsgCreateGauge` message. 

The `NewAddToGaugeCmd` function returns a `osmocli.TxCliDesc` and a `types.MsgAddToGauge`. The `osmocli.TxCliDesc` contains information about the command, such as the use case, short and long descriptions, and examples. The `types.MsgAddToGauge` is a message that is sent to the blockchain to add tokens to an existing gauge. 

The `NewStakeCmd` function returns a `osmocli.TxCliDesc` and a `types.MsgStake`. The `osmocli.TxCliDesc` contains information about the command, such as the use case, short and long descriptions, and examples. The `types.MsgStake` is a message that is sent to the blockchain to stake tokens into the stakeup pool from a user account. 

The `NewUnstakeCmd` function returns a `osmocli.TxCliDesc` and a `types.MsgUnstake`. The `osmocli.TxCliDesc` contains information about the command, such as the use case, short and long descriptions, and examples. The `types.MsgUnstake` is a message that is sent to the blockchain to unstake tokens from the stakeup pool. 

Overall, the `cli` package provides a user-friendly way for users to interact with the incentives module of the Duality project. Users can create gauges, add to gauges, stake tokens, and unstake tokens using the CLI.
