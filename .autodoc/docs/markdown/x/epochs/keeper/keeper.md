The `keeper` package contains the implementation of the `Keeper` struct, which is responsible for managing the state of the `epochs` module in the larger `duality` project. The `Keeper` struct has two fields: `storeKey` of type `sdk.StoreKey` and `hooks` of type `types.EpochHooks`. 

The `NewKeeper` function is a constructor for the `Keeper` struct. It takes a `storeKey` of type `sdk.StoreKey` as input and returns a new instance of the `Keeper` struct. This function is used to initialize a new `Keeper` instance when the `epochs` module is initialized.

The `SetHooks` method is used to set the `hooks` field of the `Keeper` struct. It takes an `EpochHooks` object as input and returns a pointer to the `Keeper` instance. If the `hooks` field has already been set, this method will panic. This method is used to set the hooks for the `epochs` module, which are called at the beginning and end of each epoch.

The `Logger` method is used to get a logger instance for the `epochs` module. It takes a `sdk.Context` object as input and returns a `log.Logger` instance. This method is used to log messages related to the `epochs` module.

Overall, the `keeper` package provides the implementation of the `Keeper` struct, which is responsible for managing the state of the `epochs` module in the larger `duality` project. The `NewKeeper` function is used to initialize a new `Keeper` instance, the `SetHooks` method is used to set the hooks for the `epochs` module, and the `Logger` method is used to get a logger instance for the `epochs` module.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Keeper` struct?
   - The `Keeper` struct is used to store a `sdk.StoreKey` and `types.EpochHooks` and provide methods to interact with them.

2. What is the `NewKeeper` function used for?
   - The `NewKeeper` function returns a new instance of the `Keeper` struct with the provided `sdk.StoreKey`.

3. What is the purpose of the `SetHooks` function?
   - The `SetHooks` function is used to set the `types.EpochHooks` for the `Keeper` instance, but it can only be called once.
