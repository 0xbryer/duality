The code in this file is a part of the duality project and is located in the `keeper` package. The purpose of this code is to define a gRPC query server for the `x/epochs` module of the duality project. The `Querier` struct is defined as a wrapper around the `Keeper` struct of the `x/epochs` module, which provides gRPC method handlers. The `Keeper` struct is responsible for managing the state of the `x/epochs` module.

The `NewQuerier` function initializes a new `Querier` struct with the provided `Keeper` struct. The `EpochInfos` method provides running epoch information by calling the `AllEpochInfos` method of the `Keeper` struct. The `CurrentEpoch` method provides the current epoch of a specified identifier by calling the `GetEpochInfo` method of the `Keeper` struct.

This code is used to provide a gRPC interface for querying epoch information in the duality project. The `EpochInfos` method can be used to retrieve information about all running epochs, while the `CurrentEpoch` method can be used to retrieve information about a specific epoch. This code is an important part of the duality project as it allows external clients to query epoch information in a standardized way. 

Example usage of the `EpochInfos` method:
```
conn, err := grpc.Dial(address, grpc.WithInsecure())
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to dial: %v", err)
}
defer conn.Close()

client := types.NewQueryClient(conn)

resp, err := client.EpochInfos(context.Background(), &types.QueryEpochsInfoRequest{})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to query epoch infos: %v", err)
}

for _, epoch := range resp.Epochs {
    fmt.Printf("Epoch %s started at %s\n", epoch.Identifier, epoch.StartTime)
}
```

Example usage of the `CurrentEpoch` method:
```
conn, err := grpc.Dial(address, grpc.WithInsecure())
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to dial: %v", err)
}
defer conn.Close()

client := types.NewQueryClient(conn)

resp, err := client.CurrentEpoch(context.Background(), &types.QueryCurrentEpochRequest{Identifier: "epoch-1"})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to query current epoch: %v", err)
}

fmt.Printf("Current epoch of epoch-1 is %d\n", resp.CurrentEpoch)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file is a part of the `duality` project and defines a gRPC method handler for querying epoch information.

2. What dependencies does this code file have?
- This code file imports several packages, including `cosmos-sdk/types`, `google.golang.org/grpc/codes`, and `google.golang.org/grpc/status`.

3. What functionality does this code file provide?
- This code file provides two gRPC method handlers: `EpochInfos` which returns running epochInfos, and `CurrentEpoch` which returns the current epoch of a specified identifier.
