The `epochs` module is designed to allow other modules in the SDK to run certain code periodically. It creates a generalized epoch interface that other modules can use to signal events at specified intervals. For example, another module can specify that it wants to execute code once a week, starting at a specific UTC time. The `epochs` module contains functionality for querying epoch, events for BeginBlock and EndBlock, and initialization for epoch-related information.

The `epochs` module is implemented as a Go package and contains two structs: `AppModuleBasic` and `AppModule`. `AppModuleBasic` implements the `AppModuleBasic` interface for the capability module. It contains methods for registering the module's Amino codec, registering the module's interface types, returning the module's default genesis state, validating the module's genesis state, registering the module's REST service handlers, registering the gRPC Gateway routes for the module, and returning the module's root query command. `AppModule` implements the `AppModule` interface for the capability module. It contains methods for registering the module's query server, initializing the module's genesis state, exporting the module's genesis state, executing all ABCI BeginBlock logic respective to the capability module, executing all ABCI EndBlock logic respective to the capability module, and returning the module's consensus version.

The `epochs` module is used in the larger project to allow other modules to run code periodically. Other modules can use the `epochs` module's generalized epoch interface to signal events at specified intervals. For example, a module that needs to execute code once a week can use the `epochs` module to specify the time and interval at which the code should be executed. The `epochs` module provides a convenient way for other modules to schedule and execute code at specified intervals without having to implement their own scheduling logic.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `epochs` module?
- The purpose of the `epochs` module is to allow other modules to set that they would like to be signaled once every period, and to create a generalized epoch interface to other modules so that they can easily be signalled upon such events.

2. What functionality does the `epochs` module contain?
- The `epochs` module contains functionality for querying epoch, events for BeginBlock and EndBlock, and initialization for epoch-related infos.

3. What interfaces and services does the `epochs` module register?
- The `epochs` module registers the module's interface types and a GRPC query service to respond to the module-specific GRPC queries.
