The `types` package contains functions for validating epoch identifiers. The `ValidateEpochIdentifierInterface` function takes an interface as input and attempts to convert it to a string. If the conversion is successful, it calls the `ValidateEpochIdentifierString` function to validate the string. If the conversion fails, it returns an error indicating that the parameter type is invalid.

The `ValidateEpochIdentifierString` function takes a string as input and checks if it is empty. If the string is empty, it returns an error indicating that the distribution epoch identifier is empty.

These functions are likely used in the larger project to ensure that epoch identifiers are valid before they are used in other parts of the code. For example, if the project has a function that takes an epoch identifier as input, it could call `ValidateEpochIdentifierInterface` to ensure that the input is a valid string before proceeding with the rest of the function.

Here is an example usage of these functions:

```
epochID := "20220101"
err := ValidateEpochIdentifierString(epochID)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

// or

var epochIDInterface interface{} = "20220101"
err := ValidateEpochIdentifierInterface(epochIDInterface)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ValidateEpochIdentifierInterface` function?
   - The `ValidateEpochIdentifierInterface` function takes an interface as input and checks if it can be converted to a string. If it can, it calls the `ValidateEpochIdentifierString` function to validate the string. If not, it returns an error.
2. What is the expected input for the `ValidateEpochIdentifierString` function?
   - The `ValidateEpochIdentifierString` function expects a non-empty string as input. If an empty string is passed, it returns an error.
3. What package dependencies does this file have?
   - This file only has one package dependency, which is the `fmt` package.
