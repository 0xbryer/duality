The `types` package in the `duality` project contains an interface called `EpochHooks` and a type called `MultiEpochHooks`. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to define hooks that can be executed at the end and start of an epoch in a blockchain system. 

The `EpochHooks` interface defines two methods: `AfterEpochEnd` and `BeforeEpochStart`. These methods take in a `sdk.Context` object, an `epochIdentifier` string, and an `epochNumber` integer. The `AfterEpochEnd` method is called when an epoch is about to end, and the `BeforeEpochStart` method is called when a new epoch is about to start. The `epochIdentifier` string is a unique identifier for the epoch, and the `epochNumber` integer is the number of the epoch that is ending or starting.

The `MultiEpochHooks` type is a slice of `EpochHooks` that allows multiple hooks to be combined. The `NewMultiEpochHooks` function takes in a variable number of `EpochHooks` and returns a `MultiEpochHooks` slice. The `AfterEpochEnd` and `BeforeEpochStart` methods of `MultiEpochHooks` iterate over the slice of hooks and call the corresponding method for each hook. 

The `panicCatchingEpochHook` function is a helper function that takes in a `sdk.Context` object, a hook function, an `epochIdentifier` string, and an `epochNumber` integer. It wraps the hook function in a new function that catches any panics that occur when the hook function is executed. If a panic occurs, the function logs an error message to the context logger.

Overall, this code provides a way to define and execute hooks at the end and start of an epoch in a blockchain system. This can be useful for performing certain actions or calculations at specific points in time, such as updating rewards or resetting certain values. Here is an example of how this code might be used:

```go
type MyEpochHook struct {}

func (h MyEpochHook) AfterEpochEnd(ctx sdk.Context, epochIdentifier string, epochNumber int64) error {
    // perform some action at the end of an epoch
    return nil
}

func (h MyEpochHook) BeforeEpochStart(ctx sdk.Context, epochIdentifier string, epochNumber int64) error {
    // perform some action at the start of a new epoch
    return nil
}

// create a new MultiEpochHooks slice with a single MyEpochHook
myHooks := NewMultiEpochHooks(MyEpochHook{})

// execute the AfterEpochEnd hook for all hooks in the slice
myHooks.AfterEpochEnd(ctx, "myEpoch", 1)

// execute the BeforeEpochStart hook for all hooks in the slice
myHooks.BeforeEpochStart(ctx, "myEpoch", 2)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EpochHooks` interface?
   - The `EpochHooks` interface defines two methods that are called before and after an epoch ends, and is likely used to execute certain actions at the end or beginning of an epoch.
2. What is the purpose of the `MultiEpochHooks` type and how is it used?
   - The `MultiEpochHooks` type is used to combine multiple `EpochHooks` instances, and all hook functions are run in array sequence. It is used to execute multiple epoch hooks in a specific order.
3. What is the purpose of the `panicCatchingEpochHook` function and how is it used?
   - The `panicCatchingEpochHook` function is used to catch any panics that occur when executing an epoch hook function. It wraps the hook function with a new function that catches any panics and logs an error message. It is used to prevent the entire program from crashing due to a panic in an epoch hook function.
