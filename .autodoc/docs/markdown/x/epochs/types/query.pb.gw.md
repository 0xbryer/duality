This file is a part of the types package, which is a reverse proxy that translates gRPC into RESTful JSON APIs. The purpose of this file is to define the HTTP handlers for the Query service of the duality project. 

The RegisterQueryHandlerServer function registers the HTTP handlers for the Query service to the provided ServeMux. It takes a context, a ServeMux, and a QueryServer as input. The function registers two HTTP handlers for the EpochInfos and CurrentEpoch methods of the Query service. The EpochInfos handler sends a request to the EpochInfos gRPC method of the QueryServer and returns the response as a JSON object. The CurrentEpoch handler sends a request to the CurrentEpoch gRPC method of the QueryServer and returns the response as a JSON object. 

The RegisterQueryHandlerFromEndpoint function is similar to RegisterQueryHandlerServer, but it automatically dials to the provided endpoint and closes the connection when the context is done. 

The RegisterQueryHandlerClient function registers the HTTP handlers for the Query service to the provided ServeMux. It takes a context, a ServeMux, and a QueryClient as input. The function registers two HTTP handlers for the EpochInfos and CurrentEpoch methods of the Query service. The EpochInfos handler sends a request to the EpochInfos gRPC method of the QueryClient and returns the response as a JSON object. The CurrentEpoch handler sends a request to the CurrentEpoch gRPC method of the QueryClient and returns the response as a JSON object. 

Overall, this file defines the HTTP handlers for the Query service of the duality project, allowing clients to make RESTful JSON API requests to the Query service.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file is a reverse proxy that translates gRPC into RESTful JSON APIs for the duality/epochs/query.proto service.

2. What functions are available for querying epoch information?
- There are two functions available for querying epoch information: `request_Query_EpochInfos_0` and `local_request_Query_EpochInfos_0`.

3. What is the purpose of the `RegisterQueryHandlerServer` function?
- The `RegisterQueryHandlerServer` function registers the HTTP handlers for the Query service to a ServeMux, allowing for unary RPC calls to the QueryServer directly.
