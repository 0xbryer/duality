The `types` package contains various data types used throughout the `duality` project. The purpose of this code is to define a custom data type called `Vector2D`, which represents a 2-dimensional vector with `x` and `y` components. This data type is useful for representing positions, velocities, and other physical quantities in a 2D space.

The `Vector2D` type is defined as a struct with two fields: `X` and `Y`, both of type `float64`. The struct also includes several methods that allow for basic vector arithmetic, such as addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication. These methods are defined using pointer receivers, which allows them to modify the original `Vector2D` object rather than creating a new one.

Here is an example of how the `Vector2D` type might be used in the larger `duality` project:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "duality/types"
)

func main() {
    // Create two vectors
    v1 := types.Vector2D{X: 1.0, Y: 2.0}
    v2 := types.Vector2D{X: 3.0, Y: 4.0}

    // Add the vectors
    v3 := v1.Add(&v2)

    // Print the result
    fmt.Println(v3) // Output: {4 6}
}
```

In this example, we create two `Vector2D` objects `v1` and `v2`, and then add them together using the `Add` method. The resulting vector `v3` is then printed to the console. This demonstrates how the `Vector2D` type can be used to perform basic vector arithmetic in a 2D space.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `types` package in the `duality` project?
   - The `types` package likely contains definitions for custom data types used throughout the `duality` project.

2. Are there any dependencies required for this code to function properly?
   - It is unclear from this code snippet whether there are any dependencies required for this code to function properly. Further investigation into the `duality` project and its dependencies may be necessary.

3. Is there any documentation available for the functions and variables defined in this package?
   - It is not clear from this code snippet whether there is any documentation available for the functions and variables defined in this package. A smart developer may want to check if there is any accompanying documentation or comments within the code itself.
