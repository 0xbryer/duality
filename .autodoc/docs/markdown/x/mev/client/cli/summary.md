The code in the `cli` package of the duality project provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) module. It consists of several files that define and implement various commands for querying and sending transactions related to the MEV module.

`query.go` defines the `GetQueryCmd` function, which returns a Cobra command for querying the MEV module. This command can be used to retrieve information about the module's parameters, for example:

```
dualitycli query mev params
```

`query_params.go` contains the `CmdQueryParams` function, which defines a CLI command for querying the parameters of the MEV module. When executed, this command sends a request to the MEV module to retrieve its parameters and prints the response to the console.

`tx.go` provides transaction commands for the MEV module through the `GetTxCmd()` function. This function returns a `cobra.Command` object representing the transaction commands for the MEV module and adds a subcommand created by the `CmdSend()` function.

`tx_send.go` defines the `CmdSend()` function, which creates a CLI command for sending messages to the blockchain network. Users can send tokens between accounts or interact with other smart contracts on the network using this command, for example:

```
dualitycli send 1000 duality
```

This command sends 1000 `duality` tokens from the sender's account to another account on the network.

Overall, the code in the `cli` package enables users to interact with the MEV module of the duality project through a command-line interface. This makes it easier for users to explore and understand the functionality of the module, as well as perform various operations such as querying parameters and sending transactions.
