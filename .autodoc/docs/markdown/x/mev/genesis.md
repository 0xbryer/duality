This code is a part of the duality project and is located in the `mev` package. The purpose of this code is to initialize and export the genesis state of the `mev` module. 

The `InitGenesis` function takes in three parameters: a `sdk.Context` object, a `keeper.Keeper` object, and a `types.GenesisState` object. This function initializes the state of the `mev` module from the provided genesis state. The function sets the module's parameters using the `SetParams` method of the `keeper.Keeper` object. 

The `ExportGenesis` function takes in two parameters: a `sdk.Context` object and a `keeper.Keeper` object. This function exports the genesis state of the `mev` module. The function creates a new `types.GenesisState` object using the `DefaultGenesis` method of the `types` package. The function then sets the module's parameters using the `GetParams` method of the `keeper.Keeper` object. Finally, the function returns the `types.GenesisState` object. 

This code is important for the duality project because it allows for the initialization and export of the `mev` module's state. This module is likely a critical component of the larger project and may be used to manage and track various aspects of the project's functionality. 

Example usage of this code may include initializing the `mev` module's state with specific parameters at the start of the project, and exporting the module's state at the end of the project for backup or analysis purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `mev` package and how does it relate to the `duality` project?
   
   The `mev` package is a sub-package of the `duality` project and contains code related to the manipulation of miner extracted value (MEV) on the Duality blockchain.

2. What is the `InitGenesis` function responsible for and what parameters does it take in?
   
   The `InitGenesis` function initializes the state of the `mev` module from a provided genesis state. It takes in a `sdk.Context` object, a `keeper.Keeper` object, and a `types.GenesisState` object as parameters.

3. What is the purpose of the `ExportGenesis` function and what does it return?
   
   The `ExportGenesis` function returns the exported genesis state of the `mev` module. It takes in a `sdk.Context` object and a `keeper.Keeper` object as parameters, and returns a pointer to a `types.GenesisState` object.
