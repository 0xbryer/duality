The `keeper` package in the `duality` project is responsible for interacting with the state of the blockchain, including reading and writing data, managing parameters, and handling transactions and events. It contains a `Keeper` struct and a `NewKeeper` function that returns an instance of this struct. The `Keeper` struct has several fields, such as a binary codec, two store keys, a parameter subspace, and a bank keeper.

The `Keeper` struct provides methods for reading and writing data to the blockchain and handling transactions and events. The `bankKeeper` field is used to interact with the `duality` bank module, while the `paramstore` field is used to manage the parameters of the `duality` module. The `Logger` method returns a logger for logging messages related to the `duality` module.

The `msgServer` struct in the `msg_server.go` file implements the `types.MsgServer` interface, providing an implementation for the `Keeper` struct. The `NewMsgServerImpl` function creates a new instance of the `msgServer` struct with the provided `Keeper` struct, which is then used to handle messages sent to the `duality` network.

The `Send` function in the `msg_server_send.go` file is responsible for sending coins from a user's account to a module's account. It takes in a context and a message of type `MsgSend`, processes the transaction, and returns a `MsgSendResponse` object.

The `params.go` file contains the `GetParams` and `SetParams` functions, which are used to retrieve and set parameters for the `mev` module of the `duality` project. This module handles miner-extractable value (MEV) transactions on the `duality` blockchain.

Example usage:

```go
// Create a new instance of the Keeper struct
keeper := NewKeeper(...)
msgServer := NewMsgServerImpl(keeper)

// Send tokens
msg := &types.MsgSend{
    Creator: "user1",
    TokenIn: "dual",
    AmountIn: 100,
}
ctx := context.Background()
response, err := msgServer.Send(ctx, msg)

// Retrieve and set parameters for the mev module
params := keeper.GetParams(ctx)
keeper.SetParams(ctx, params)
```

In summary, the `keeper` package provides essential components for interacting with the state of the `duality` blockchain, such as the `Keeper` struct and the `NewKeeper` function. It also contains implementations for handling messages and managing parameters for the `mev` module.
