The code in this file is responsible for handling various message types related to the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) functionality within the Duality project. It imports necessary packages and defines a `NewHandler` function that takes a `keeper.Keeper` object as an argument and returns an `sdk.Handler` function.

The `NewHandler` function initializes a `msgServer` object using the `keeper.NewMsgServerImpl` method, which is responsible for implementing the actual logic for handling the different message types. The returned `sdk.Handler` function takes an `sdk.Context` and an `sdk.Msg` as arguments, and processes the message based on its type.

The following message types are supported:

1. `types.MsgDeposit`: Handles depositing tokens into the DEX. The `msgServer.Deposit` method is called with the context and message, and the result is wrapped using `sdk.WrapServiceResult`.

2. `types.MsgWithdrawal`: Handles withdrawing tokens from the DEX. The `msgServer.Withdrawal` method is called with the context and message, and the result is wrapped using `sdk.WrapServiceResult`.

3. `types.MsgSwap`: Handles swapping tokens within the DEX. The `msgServer.Swap` method is called with the context and message, and the result is wrapped using `sdk.WrapServiceResult`.

4. `types.MsgPlaceLimitOrder`: Handles placing a limit order on the DEX. The `msgServer.PlaceLimitOrder` method is called with the context and message, and the result is wrapped using `sdk.WrapServiceResult`.

5. `types.MsgWithdrawFilledLimitOrder`: Handles withdrawing filled limit orders from the DEX. The `msgServer.WithdrawFilledLimitOrder` method is called with the context and message, and the result is wrapped using `sdk.WrapServiceResult`.

6. `types.MsgCancelLimitOrder`: Handles canceling limit orders on the DEX. The `msgServer.CancelLimitOrder` method is called with the context and message, and the result is wrapped using `sdk.WrapServiceResult`.

7. `types.MsgMultiHopSwap`: Handles multi-hop swaps within the DEX. The `msgServer.MultiHopSwap` method is called with the context and message, and the result is wrapped using `sdk.WrapServiceResult`.

If an unrecognized message type is encountered, an error is returned with a message indicating the unrecognized type.

This code is essential for enabling the core functionalities of the DEX within the larger Duality project, allowing users to interact with the exchange through various actions such as deposits, withdrawals, swaps, and limit orders.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `NewHandler` function?**

   The `NewHandler` function is responsible for creating a new handler that processes various message types related to the duality project, such as deposit, withdrawal, swap, and limit order operations.

2. **How does the `NewHandler` function handle different message types?**

   The `NewHandler` function uses a switch statement to handle different message types. For each message type, it calls the corresponding method from the `msgServer` and wraps the result using `sdk.WrapServiceResult`.

3. **What happens if an unrecognized message type is passed to the `NewHandler` function?**

   If an unrecognized message type is passed to the `NewHandler` function, it returns an error with the message "unrecognized message type" and the type of the message, wrapped using `sdkerrors.Wrap` with the `sdkerrors.ErrUnknownRequest` error code.
