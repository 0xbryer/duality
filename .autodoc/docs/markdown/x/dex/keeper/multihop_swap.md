The code in this file is responsible for handling multi-hop trading routes in the Duality project. It defines a `MultihopStep` struct, which represents a single step in a multi-hop trading route, and provides functions to calculate the best route and execute trades along that route.

The `HopsToRouteData` function takes a list of token symbols (hops) and an exit limit price, and returns an array of `MultihopStep` structs representing the best trading route. It calculates the best price for each trading pair in the route and checks if the exit limit price is hit. If the exit limit price is hit, it returns an error.

The `CalcMultihopPriceUpperbound` function calculates the upper bound of the price for a multi-hop route, given the current price and the remaining steps in the route.

The `MultihopStep` function executes a single step in a multi-hop trading route. It takes a `BranchableCache` (a cache that can be branched), a `MultihopStep`, an input coin, an exit limit price, a current price, a list of remaining steps, and a step cache. It calculates the price upper bound and checks if the exit limit price is hit. If the exit limit price is hit, it returns an error. It then checks if the step result is cached, and if so, returns the cached result. Otherwise, it executes the trade and caches the result.

The `RunMultihopRoute` function takes a context, a `MultiHopRoute`, an initial input coin, an exit limit price, and a step cache. It calculates the route data using `HopsToRouteData` and initializes a `BranchableCache`. It then iterates through the route data, executing each step using the `MultihopStep` function. If the exit limit price is hit, it returns an error. Finally, it returns the output coin and a function to write the cache.

These functions can be used in the larger project to find the best trading route for a multi-hop trade and execute the trade along that route, while caching intermediate results for efficiency.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `MultihopStep` struct and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer**: The `MultihopStep` struct represents a single step in a multi-hop trade route, containing the best price and trading pair for that step. It is used in the `HopsToRouteData` function to build an array of `MultihopStep` instances, which is then used in the `RunMultihopRoute` function to execute the multi-hop trade.

2. **Question**: How does the `HopsToRouteData` function work and what is its role in the overall code?
   **Answer**: The `HopsToRouteData` function takes an array of token symbols (hops) and an exit limit price as input, and returns an array of `MultihopStep` instances representing the best trading route between the tokens. It is used in the `RunMultihopRoute` function to determine the optimal route for a multi-hop trade.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `stepCache` map and how is it used in the `MultihopStep` and `RunMultihopRoute` functions?
   **Answer**: The `stepCache` map is used to store the results of previous multi-hop steps to avoid redundant calculations and improve performance. It is passed as an argument to the `MultihopStep` function, which checks if the current step's result is already in the cache before performing the trade. The `RunMultihopRoute` function also uses the `stepCache` to store the results of each step as it iterates through the route.
