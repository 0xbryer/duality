The `keeper` package contains functions for managing inactive limit order tranches in the Duality project. The `LimitOrderTranche` struct represents a specific tranche of a limit order that is not currently active. The purpose of this code is to provide functions for storing, retrieving, and deleting inactive limit order tranches from the store.

The `SetInactiveLimitOrderTranche` function takes a `LimitOrderTranche` object and stores it in the key-value store. The object is serialized using the `cdc.MustMarshal` function and stored using the `store.Set` function. The key used to store the object is generated using the `InactiveLimitOrderTrancheKey` function, which takes the `PairID`, `TokenIn`, `TickIndex`, and `TrancheKey` fields of the `LimitOrderTranche` object.

The `GetInactiveLimitOrderTranche` function retrieves a `LimitOrderTranche` object from the store using the same key generated by the `InactiveLimitOrderTrancheKey` function. If the object is found, it is deserialized using the `cdc.MustUnmarshal` function and returned along with a boolean value indicating whether the object was found.

The `RemoveInactiveLimitOrderTranche` function removes a `LimitOrderTranche` object from the store using the same key generated by the `InactiveLimitOrderTrancheKey` function. The object is deleted using the `store.Delete` function.

The `GetAllInactiveLimitOrderTranche` function returns a list of all `LimitOrderTranche` objects stored in the key-value store. It does this by iterating over all keys in the store using the `sdk.KVStorePrefixIterator` function and deserializing each object using the `cdc.MustUnmarshal` function.

The `SaveInactiveTranche` function is a convenience function that takes a `LimitOrderTranche` object and either stores it or deletes it from the store depending on whether it has a `TokenIn` or `TokenOut` field. If it has a `TokenIn` or `TokenOut` field, it is stored using the `SetInactiveLimitOrderTranche` function. Otherwise, it is deleted using the `RemoveInactiveLimitOrderTranche` function.

Overall, these functions provide a way to manage inactive limit order tranches in the Duality project. They can be used to store, retrieve, and delete tranches from the key-value store, as well as retrieve a list of all stored tranches. The `SaveInactiveTranche` function provides a convenient way to manage tranches based on their `TokenIn` and `TokenOut` fields.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `duality-labs/duality/x/dex/types` package?
   - This package is imported to define the `LimitOrderTranche` type used in the code.
2. What is the difference between `SetInactiveLimitOrderTranche` and `SaveInactiveTranche` functions?
   - `SetInactiveLimitOrderTranche` sets a specific `LimitOrderTranche` in the store, while `SaveInactiveTranche` saves or removes a `LimitOrderTranche` based on whether it has `TokenIn` or `TokenOut`.
3. What is the meaning of `KeyPrefix(types.InactiveLimitOrderTrancheKeyPrefix)`?
   - `KeyPrefix(types.InactiveLimitOrderTrancheKeyPrefix)` is a prefix used to identify the keys in the store that correspond to inactive limit order tranches.
