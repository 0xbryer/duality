The code in this file is a part of the duality project and is located in the `keeper` package. The purpose of this code is to define two functions that allow for the retrieval and setting of parameters related to the decentralized exchange (DEX) module of the duality project.

The first function, `GetParams`, is a getter function that retrieves all parameters related to the DEX module as a `types.Params` object. This function takes in a `sdk.Context` object as a parameter, but it is not used in the function body. The `types.Params` object returned by this function is created using the `NewParams` function from the `types` package of the DEX module.

The second function, `SetParams`, is a setter function that sets the parameters related to the DEX module. This function takes in two parameters: a `sdk.Context` object and a `types.Params` object. The `sdk.Context` object is used to interact with the blockchain and store the parameters in the parameter store. The `types.Params` object is the set of parameters that will be stored in the parameter store. The `paramstore` object is used to set the parameter set in the context.

These functions are important for the DEX module of the duality project because they allow for the retrieval and setting of parameters related to the module. These parameters can include things like the minimum and maximum trade sizes, the fee structure for trades, and other important settings that affect the behavior of the DEX module. By allowing for the retrieval and setting of these parameters, the DEX module can be customized to fit the needs of the project and its users.

Example usage of these functions might look like:

```
// retrieve the current DEX module parameters
params := keeper.GetParams(ctx)

// modify the parameters
params.MinTradeSize = sdk.NewInt(1000)

// set the modified parameters
keeper.SetParams(ctx, params)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `keeper` package in the `duality` project?
- The `keeper` package likely contains functionality related to managing state and interacting with the blockchain in some way.

2. What is the `paramstore` variable and where is it defined?
- The `paramstore` variable is likely a field of the `Keeper` struct, but its definition is not shown in this code snippet.

3. What is the expected behavior of the `GetParams` and `SetParams` functions?
- `GetParams` returns an instance of the `types.Params` struct, while `SetParams` sets the parameters in the `paramstore` using the provided `sdk.Context` and `types.Params` arguments.
