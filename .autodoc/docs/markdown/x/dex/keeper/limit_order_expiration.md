The code in this file is part of the `keeper` package and is responsible for managing limit order expirations in a decentralized exchange (DEX) module of the Duality project. It provides functions to set, get, remove, and retrieve all limit order expirations, as well as a function to purge expired limit orders based on the current time.

The `SetLimitOrderExpiration` function sets a specific `goodTilRecord` in the store using its index. It creates a new store with the appropriate key prefix and marshals the `goodTilRecord` before setting it in the store.

```go
func (k Keeper) SetLimitOrderExpiration(ctx sdk.Context, goodTilRecord types.LimitOrderExpiration) { ... }
```

The `GetLimitOrderExpiration` function retrieves a `goodTilRecord` from the store using its index. It returns the record and a boolean indicating whether the record was found.

```go
func (k Keeper) GetLimitOrderExpiration(ctx sdk.Context, goodTilDate time.Time, trancheRef []byte) (val types.LimitOrderExpiration, found bool) { ... }
```

The `RemoveLimitOrderExpiration` and `RemoveLimitOrderExpirationByKey` functions remove a `goodTilRecord` from the store using either its index or key.

```go
func (k Keeper) RemoveLimitOrderExpiration(ctx sdk.Context, goodTilDate time.Time, trancheRef []byte) { ... }
func (k Keeper) RemoveLimitOrderExpirationByKey(ctx sdk.Context, key []byte) { ... }
```

The `GetAllLimitOrderExpiration` function retrieves all `goodTilRecord` instances from the store and returns them in a list.

```go
func (k Keeper) GetAllLimitOrderExpiration(ctx sdk.Context) (list []types.LimitOrderExpiration) { ... }
```

The `PurgeExpiredLimitOrders` function iterates through all limit order expirations and removes those that have expired based on the current time. It also checks for gas consumption and stops deleting records if the gas limit is reached, emitting an event in such cases.

```go
func (k Keeper) PurgeExpiredLimitOrders(ctx sdk.Context, curTime time.Time) { ... }
```

These functions are essential for managing limit order expirations in the DEX module, ensuring that expired orders are removed and the system remains efficient and secure.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `SetLimitOrderExpiration` function and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `SetLimitOrderExpiration` function sets a specific `goodTilRecord` in the store using its index. It creates a new store with the given context and key prefix, marshals the `goodTilRecord` into bytes, and then sets the key-value pair in the store using the `ExpirationTime` and `TrancheRef` of the `goodTilRecord`.

2. **Question**: How does the `PurgeExpiredLimitOrders` function work and what is its purpose?
   **Answer**: The `PurgeExpiredLimitOrders` function is responsible for removing expired limit orders from the store. It iterates through all the `goodTilRecord` entries in the store, checks if the `ExpirationTime` is after the current time, and removes the expired records. It also takes care of gas consumption and stops deleting records if the gas consumed reaches a certain limit.

3. **Question**: What is the role of the `GetAllLimitOrderExpiration` function and how does it retrieve all `goodTilRecord` entries?
   **Answer**: The `GetAllLimitOrderExpiration` function retrieves all `goodTilRecord` entries from the store. It creates a new store with the given context and key prefix, initializes an iterator to iterate through the store, and unmarshals the values into `LimitOrderExpiration` objects, appending them to a list which is returned at the end.
