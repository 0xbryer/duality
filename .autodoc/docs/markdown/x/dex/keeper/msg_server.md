The `keeper` package contains an implementation of the `types.MsgServer` interface for the `duality` project's decentralized exchange (DEX). The `msgServer` struct is defined to include a `Keeper` instance, which is used to interact with the DEX's state. 

The `NewMsgServerImpl` function returns an instance of the `msgServer` struct, which implements the `types.MsgServer` interface. This function takes a `Keeper` instance as an argument and returns an instance of the `types.MsgServer` interface. This function is used to create a new instance of the `msgServer` struct, which is used to handle incoming messages from clients.

The `msgServer` struct implements several methods that handle different types of messages. These methods include `Deposit`, `Withdrawal`, `Swap`, `PlaceLimitOrder`, `WithdrawFilledLimitOrder`, `CancelLimitOrder`, and `MultiHopSwap`. Each of these methods takes a context and a message as arguments and returns a response and an error.

The `Deposit` method handles depositing tokens into the DEX. It takes a `MsgDeposit` message as an argument, which includes the tokens to be deposited, the amounts to be deposited, and the fees to be paid. The method sorts the tokens and amounts, normalizes the tick indexes, and then calls the `DepositCore` method on the `Keeper` instance to deposit the tokens.

The `Withdrawal` method handles withdrawing tokens from the DEX. It takes a `MsgWithdrawal` message as an argument, which includes the tokens to be withdrawn, the shares to be removed, and the fees to be paid. The method sorts the tokens, normalizes the tick indexes, and then calls the `WithdrawCore` method on the `Keeper` instance to withdraw the tokens.

The `Swap` method handles swapping tokens on the DEX. It takes a `MsgSwap` message as an argument, which includes the tokens to be swapped, the amounts to be swapped, and the fees to be paid. The method calls the `SwapCore` method on the `Keeper` instance to perform the swap.

The `PlaceLimitOrder` method handles placing a limit order on the DEX. It takes a `MsgPlaceLimitOrder` message as an argument, which includes the tokens to be traded, the amount to be traded, the tick index, the order type, the expiration time, and the fees to be paid. The method normalizes the tick index and then calls the `PlaceLimitOrderCore` method on the `Keeper` instance to place the limit order.

The `WithdrawFilledLimitOrder` method handles withdrawing a filled limit order from the DEX. It takes a `MsgWithdrawFilledLimitOrder` message as an argument, which includes the tranche key of the filled limit order and the fees to be paid. The method calls the `WithdrawFilledLimitOrderCore` method on the `Keeper` instance to withdraw the filled limit order.

The `CancelLimitOrder` method handles canceling a limit order on the DEX. It takes a `MsgCancelLimitOrder` message as an argument, which includes the tranche key of the limit order and the fees to be paid. The method calls the `CancelLimitOrderCore` method on the `Keeper` instance to cancel the limit order.

The `MultiHopSwap` method handles performing a multi-hop swap on the DEX. It takes a `MsgMultiHopSwap` message as an argument, which includes the amount to be swapped, the routes to be taken, the exit limit price, the pick best route flag, and the fees to be paid. The method calls the `MultiHopSwapCore` method on the `Keeper` instance to perform the multi-hop swap.

Overall, this package provides an implementation of the `types.MsgServer` interface for the `duality` project's DEX. The methods provided by this package handle different types of messages that can be sent to the DEX, such as depositing tokens, withdrawing tokens, swapping tokens, placing limit orders, and performing multi-hop swaps. These methods interact with the DEX's state through the `Keeper` instance provided to the `msgServer` struct.
