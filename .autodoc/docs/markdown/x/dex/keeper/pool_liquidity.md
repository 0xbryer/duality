This code is part of the `keeper` package in the Duality project, which deals with managing liquidity pools in a decentralized exchange (DEX) module. The primary purpose of this code is to facilitate token swaps between two assets in a liquidity pool and provide price information for these swaps.

The `PoolLiquidity` struct is defined with two fields: `pool`, which is a pointer to a `Pool` object, and `is0To1`, a boolean flag indicating the direction of the swap (from asset 0 to asset 1, or vice versa). The struct implements the `Liquidity` interface, which requires two methods: `Swap` and `Price`.

The `Swap` method takes two arguments, `maxAmountIn` and `maxAmountOut`, representing the maximum input and output amounts for the swap. Depending on the value of `is0To1`, it calls either `Swap0To1` or `Swap1To0` on the underlying `Pool` object, returning the actual input and output amounts for the swap.

The `Price` method returns a pointer to a `types.Price` object, which represents the price of the swap. Depending on the value of `is0To1`, it returns either the `Price0To1Upper` or `Price1To0Lower` field of the underlying `Pool` object.

Two factory functions are provided to create `PoolLiquidity` objects: `NewLiquidityFromPool0To1` and `NewLiquidityFromPool1To0`. These functions take a pointer to a `Pool` object and return a `Liquidity` interface, with the `is0To1` flag set to `true` or `false`, respectively.

In the larger project, this code can be used to manage liquidity pools and facilitate token swaps between different assets. For example, a user may want to swap tokens A and B, and the DEX module would use the `PoolLiquidity` struct and its methods to determine the price and execute the swap.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `PoolLiquidity` struct and its `is0To1` field?**

   The `PoolLiquidity` struct represents a liquidity pool in the duality project, and the `is0To1` field is a boolean flag that indicates the direction of the swap (true for 0 to 1, false for 1 to 0).

2. **How does the `Swap` function work and what are its input parameters?**

   The `Swap` function performs a swap operation in the liquidity pool. It takes two input parameters: `maxAmountIn`, which is the maximum amount of tokens to be swapped in, and `maxAmountOut`, which is the maximum amount of tokens to be swapped out. The function returns the actual amounts of tokens swapped in and out.

3. **What is the purpose of the `Price` function and what does it return?**

   The `Price` function returns the current price of the liquidity pool. Depending on the value of the `is0To1` field, it returns either the upper price for a 0 to 1 swap (`Price0To1Upper`) or the lower price for a 1 to 0 swap (`Price1To0Lower`).
