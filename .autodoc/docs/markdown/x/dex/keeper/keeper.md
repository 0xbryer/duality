The code in this file is part of the `keeper` package and is responsible for managing the state and interactions with the underlying data store for the duality project. It defines a `Keeper` struct and provides a constructor function `NewKeeper` to create a new instance of the `Keeper` struct.

The `Keeper` struct has the following fields:
- `cdc`: A codec.BinaryCodec, which is responsible for encoding and decoding data to and from the data store.
- `storeKey`: An sdk.StoreKey, which is the key used to access the main data store.
- `memKey`: Another sdk.StoreKey, which is the key used to access an in-memory data store.
- `paramstore`: A paramtypes.Subspace, which is a subspace of the parameter store used for managing module-specific parameters.
- `bankKeeper`: A types.BankKeeper, which is an interface for interacting with the bank module.

The `NewKeeper` function takes the following parameters:
- `cdc`: A codec.BinaryCodec for encoding and decoding data.
- `storeKey`: An sdk.StoreKey for the main data store.
- `memKey`: An sdk.StoreKey for the in-memory data store.
- `ps`: A paramtypes.Subspace for managing module-specific parameters.
- `bankKeeper`: A types.BankKeeper for interacting with the bank module.

The `NewKeeper` function initializes the `Keeper` struct with the provided parameters and sets the KeyTable for the parameter store if it has not been set already.

The `Logger` method on the `Keeper` struct returns a log.Logger instance with a pre-configured module name. This logger can be used to log messages related to the duality module.

In the larger project, the `Keeper` struct and its methods are used to manage the state and interact with the data store for the duality module. This includes reading and writing data, managing module-specific parameters, and interacting with other modules such as the bank module.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `Keeper` struct and its fields?

   **Answer:** The `Keeper` struct is responsible for managing the state and interactions with the store and other modules in the duality project. Its fields include a codec for encoding/decoding data, store keys for accessing the state, a parameter store for managing module parameters, and a bank keeper for interacting with the bank module.

2. **Question:** How is the `NewKeeper` function used and what does it return?

   **Answer:** The `NewKeeper` function is used to create a new instance of the `Keeper` struct with the provided arguments. It initializes the parameter store with a key table if not already set and returns a pointer to the newly created `Keeper` instance.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `Logger` function in the `Keeper` struct?

   **Answer:** The `Logger` function is used to create a logger instance with a specific module name, which helps in logging messages related to the duality module. This allows for easier debugging and tracking of events within the module.
