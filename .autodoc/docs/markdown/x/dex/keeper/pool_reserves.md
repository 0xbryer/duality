The code in this file is part of the `keeper` package and is responsible for managing the storage and retrieval of `PoolReserves` objects in the Duality project. `PoolReserves` objects represent the reserves of a liquidity pool in a decentralized exchange (DEX) and are used to facilitate token swaps and manage liquidity.

The `SetPoolReserves` function takes a `PoolReserves` object and stores it in the DEX's state using a key-value store. It first wraps the `PoolReserves` object into a `TickLiquidity` object, which is a more general structure that can hold different types of liquidity data. Then, it creates a new store with the appropriate key prefix and stores the serialized `TickLiquidity` object using a generated key based on the pool's properties.

```go
func (k Keeper) SetPoolReserves(ctx sdk.Context, pool types.PoolReserves) { ... }
```

The `GetPoolReserves` function retrieves a `PoolReserves` object from the store based on the provided parameters, such as the `pairID`, `tokenIn`, `tickIndex`, and `fee`. It creates a new store with the appropriate key prefix, generates the key based on the input parameters, and attempts to retrieve the serialized `TickLiquidity` object. If found, it deserializes the object and returns the `PoolReserves` object along with a boolean flag indicating its existence.

```go
func (k Keeper) GetPoolReserves(ctx sdk.Context, pairID *types.PairID, tokenIn string, tickIndex int64, fee uint64) (pool *types.PoolReserves, found bool) { ... }
```

The `RemovePoolReserves` function deletes a `PoolReserves` object from the store. It creates a new store with the appropriate key prefix, generates the key based on the pool's properties, and removes the corresponding entry from the store.

```go
func (k Keeper) RemovePoolReserves(ctx sdk.Context, pool types.PoolReserves) { ... }
```

These functions are essential for managing the liquidity pools in the DEX, allowing the system to add, retrieve, and remove pool reserves as needed for various operations, such as token swaps and liquidity provision.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `SetPoolReserves` function and how does it store the data?
   **Answer**: The `SetPoolReserves` function is used to store the pool reserves data in the key-value store. It wraps the pool reserves data into a `TickLiquidity` object and then marshals it into bytes before storing it with the appropriate key.

2. **Question**: How does the `GetPoolReserves` function retrieve the pool reserves data and what does it return if the data is not found?
   **Answer**: The `GetPoolReserves` function retrieves the pool reserves data by using the provided parameters to construct the key and then fetching the data from the key-value store. If the data is not found, it returns `nil` and `false`.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `RemovePoolReserves` function and how does it delete the data from the store?
   **Answer**: The `RemovePoolReserves` function is used to delete the pool reserves data from the key-value store. It constructs the key using the provided pool reserves data and then deletes the data associated with that key from the store.
