The `cli` package contains code related to the command-line interface of the `duality` project. Specifically, this file defines a constant and a function related to a command-line flag for setting the maximum amount to be returned from a trade.

The constant `FlagMaxAmountOut` is a string that represents the name of the flag. It is used in the `FlagSetMaxAmountOut` function to define the flag and its associated value.

The `FlagSetMaxAmountOut` function returns a `*flag.FlagSet` object, which is a set of flags that can be parsed from the command-line arguments. This function creates a new `FlagSet` object and adds the `FlagMaxAmountOut` flag to it. The flag is defined as a string with an empty default value and a description of its purpose.

This function can be used in the larger `duality` project to allow users to set the maximum amount to be returned from a trade via the command-line interface. For example, a user could run the following command to set the maximum amount to 100:

```
duality trade --max-amount-out 100
```

Overall, this code provides a simple and flexible way for users to customize the behavior of the `duality` project via the command-line interface.
