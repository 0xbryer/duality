The `CmdPlaceLimitOrder` function is a command-line interface (CLI) command that allows a user to place a limit order on a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Cosmos SDK. The function takes in several arguments, including the receiver of the order, the input and output tokens, the tick index, the amount of input tokens, the order type, and the expiration time. 

The function first parses the arguments and validates them. It then creates a new `MsgPlaceLimitOrder` message with the parsed arguments and validates the message. Finally, it generates and broadcasts a new transaction with the message using the `tx.GenerateOrBroadcastTxCLI` function.

This function is likely used as part of a larger CLI tool for interacting with the DEX. Users can call this command to place a limit order on the DEX, specifying the details of the order such as the tokens involved and the order type. The function then generates and broadcasts a transaction to the network to execute the order. 

Example usage of this command might look like:

```
dualitycli place-limit-order bob tokenA tokenB -10 1000 GOOD_TIL_CANCELLED '01/01/2022 12:00:00' --from alice
```

This would place a limit order for 1000 tokenA with a tick index of -10 and a good-til-cancelled order type, expiring on January 1st, 2022 at noon. The order would be placed by the account `alice` and sent to the account `bob`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   
   This code defines a Cobra command for placing a limit order on a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Cosmos SDK. The command takes in several arguments including the receiver, input and output tokens, tick index, amount in, order type, and expiration time. It then creates a new `MsgPlaceLimitOrder` message and broadcasts it to the network using the `tx.GenerateOrBroadcastTxCLI` function.

2. What are the possible values for the `order-type` argument and how are they used?
   
   The `order-type` argument is an optional argument that specifies the type of limit order being placed. If this argument is not provided, the default value is `GOOD_TIL_CANCELLED`. The possible values for `order-type` are defined in the `LimitOrderType` enum in the `types` package and include `GOOD_TIL_CANCELLED`, `GOOD_TIL_TIME`, and `IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCEL`.

3. What is the purpose of the `goodTil` variable and how is it used?
   
   The `goodTil` variable is a pointer to a `time.Time` value that represents the expiration time of a `GOOD_TIL_TIME` limit order. If the `expirationTime` argument is provided, the function parses it into a `time.Time` value using the `time.Parse` function and assigns it to `goodTil`. This value is then passed to the `MsgPlaceLimitOrder` constructor and included in the resulting message if the `order-type` is `GOOD_TIL_TIME`.
