The code above is part of the duality project and is located in the `cli` package. The purpose of this code is to provide command-line interface (CLI) commands to interact with the duality decentralized exchange (DEX) module. Specifically, this code provides two commands: `list-filled-limit-order-tranche` and `show-filled-limit-order-tranche`.

The `list-filled-limit-order-tranche` command lists all inactive limit order tranches. This command takes pagination flags to limit the number of results returned. The command retrieves the page request from the flags and creates a new query client to interact with the DEX module. The command then creates a new `QueryAllInactiveLimitOrderTrancheRequest` with the pagination information and sends it to the query client. The response is printed to the console using the client context.

The `show-filled-limit-order-tranche` command shows a specific inactive limit order tranche. This command takes four arguments: `pair-id`, `token-in`, `tick-index`, and `tranche-key`. The command retrieves the client context from the command and creates a new query client to interact with the DEX module. The command then parses the arguments and creates a new `QueryGetInactiveLimitOrderTrancheRequest` with the parsed arguments. The request is sent to the query client, and the response is printed to the console using the client context.

These commands can be used to interact with the DEX module of the duality project through the command-line interface. For example, to list all inactive limit order tranches, the following command can be used:

```
dualitycli list-filled-limit-order-tranche --limit=10
```

This command lists the first 10 inactive limit order tranches. To show a specific inactive limit order tranche, the following command can be used:

```
dualitycli show-filled-limit-order-tranche tokenA<>tokenB tokenA 10 0
```

This command shows the inactive limit order tranche with `pair-id` equal to `tokenA<>tokenB`, `token-in` equal to `tokenA`, `tick-index` equal to `10`, and `tranche-key` equal to `0`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines two Cobra commands for interacting with InactiveLimitOrderTranche data in the duality project's dex module. The first command lists all InactiveLimitOrderTranches, while the second command shows a specific InactiveLimitOrderTranche based on its pair ID, token in, tick index, and tranche key.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several packages from the Cosmos SDK, including `client`, `flags`, and `cobra`, as well as the `types` package from the duality project's dex module. It also imports `cast` from the `spf13` package.

3. What are the expected inputs and outputs of these commands?
- The `CmdListInactiveLimitOrderTranche` command takes no arguments and returns a list of all InactiveLimitOrderTranches in the system. The `CmdShowInactiveLimitOrderTranche` command takes four arguments (pair ID, token in, tick index, and tranche key) and returns the InactiveLimitOrderTranche that matches those values. Both commands use the `clientCtx.PrintProto` function to output the results in protobuf format.
