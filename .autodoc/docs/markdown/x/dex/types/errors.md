This file contains a list of error messages that are specific to the duality project's dex (decentralized exchange) module. These error messages are used to provide more detailed information to users when an error occurs within the dex module. 

Each error message is associated with a unique error code and is registered using the `sdkerrors.Register` function from the Cosmos SDK. The error messages cover a wide range of scenarios, including invalid trading pairs, insufficient liquidity, and invalid order types. 

For example, the `ErrInvalidTradingPair` error message is triggered when a user attempts to trade an invalid token pair. The error message includes the specific token pair that caused the error. 

```
ErrInvalidTradingPair = sdkerrors.Register(ModuleName, 1102, "Invalid token pair:")   // "%s<>%s", tokenA, tokenB
```

These error messages are used throughout the dex module to provide more detailed information to users when an error occurs. They can be accessed by other parts of the duality project to provide more detailed error messages to users. 

Overall, this file plays an important role in ensuring that users of the duality project have a clear understanding of what went wrong when an error occurs within the dex module.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains sentinel errors for the x/dex module in the duality project.

2. What are some examples of errors that can be thrown by this code?
- Examples of errors that can be thrown by this code include ErrInvalidTradingPair, ErrInsufficientShares, ErrValidTickNotFound, ErrValidPairNotFound, and many others.

3. What is the significance of the `sdkerrors.Register` function in this code?
- The `sdkerrors.Register` function is used to register a new sentinel error with a given module name, error code, and error message. This allows the error to be easily identified and handled within the codebase.
