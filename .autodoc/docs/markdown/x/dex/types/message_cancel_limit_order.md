This code defines a message type for cancelling a limit order in the duality project. The `MsgCancelLimitOrder` struct contains two fields: `Creator` and `TrancheKey`. The `Creator` field is a string representing the address of the account that created the limit order, while the `TrancheKey` field is a string representing the key of the tranche associated with the limit order. 

The `NewMsgCancelLimitOrder` function is a constructor for creating a new `MsgCancelLimitOrder` instance. It takes in a `creator` and `trancheKey` string and returns a pointer to a new `MsgCancelLimitOrder` instance with those fields set.

The `Route` method returns the router key for this message type, which is used to route the message to the appropriate handler.

The `Type` method returns the type of the message, which is `cancel_limit_order`.

The `GetSigners` method returns an array of `sdk.AccAddress` instances representing the signers of the message. In this case, there is only one signer, which is the account that created the limit order.

The `GetSignBytes` method returns the bytes to be signed for the message. It marshals the message into JSON format and sorts the resulting bytes.

The `ValidateBasic` method validates the basic fields of the message. It checks that the `Creator` field is a valid account address.

This code is used in the duality project to allow users to cancel limit orders that they have created. When a user wants to cancel a limit order, they create a new `MsgCancelLimitOrder` instance with their account address and the key of the tranche associated with the limit order. This message is then sent to the appropriate handler, which cancels the limit order. 

Example usage:

```
msg := types.NewMsgCancelLimitOrder("creator_address", "tranche_key")
err := msg.ValidateBasic()
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
// send message to appropriate handler to cancel limit order
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a message type for cancelling a limit order and provides functions for routing, signing, and validation.
2. What external dependencies does this code have?
   - This code imports two packages from the `cosmos-sdk` library: `types` and `types/errors`.
3. What is the expected input format for the `NewMsgCancelLimitOrder` function?
   - The `NewMsgCancelLimitOrder` function takes two string arguments: `creator` and `trancheKey`, and returns a pointer to a `MsgCancelLimitOrder` struct.
