This code is part of the `types` package and defines a set of methods for the `LimitOrderType` enumeration. The purpose of these methods is to provide a convenient way to check the type of a limit order in the context of a trading system. Limit orders are instructions to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better, and they can have different time-in-force policies, which determine how long the order remains active before it is executed or canceled.

The methods in this code are:

1. `IsGTC()`: Checks if the limit order type is "Good Till Cancelled" (GTC). GTC orders remain active until they are executed or manually canceled by the trader. Example usage: `if orderType.IsGTC() { ... }`

2. `IsFoK()`: Checks if the limit order type is "Fill or Kill" (FoK). FoK orders must be executed in their entirety immediately, or they are canceled. Example usage: `if orderType.IsFoK() { ... }`

3. `IsIoC()`: Checks if the limit order type is "Immediate or Cancel" (IoC). IoC orders are executed immediately, and any unfilled portion of the order is canceled. Example usage: `if orderType.IsIoC() { ... }`

4. `IsJIT()`: Checks if the limit order type is "Just In Time" (JIT). JIT orders are executed as close as possible to a specified time. Example usage: `if orderType.IsJIT() { ... }`

5. `IsGoodTil()`: Checks if the limit order type is "Good Til Time" (GTT). GTT orders are active until a specified time, after which they are canceled. Example usage: `if orderType.IsGoodTil() { ... }`

6. `HasExpiration()`: Checks if the limit order type has an expiration, i.e., if it is either GTT or JIT. Example usage: `if orderType.HasExpiration() { ... }`

These methods can be used in the larger project to handle different types of limit orders and implement the appropriate logic for each type, such as order placement, execution, and cancellation.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the `LimitOrderType` type and what are its possible values?**

   The `LimitOrderType` type is not defined in the provided code snippet. It is likely an enumerated type representing different types of limit orders, such as GOOD_TIL_CANCELLED, FILL_OR_KILL, IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCEL, JUST_IN_TIME, and GOOD_TIL_TIME.

2. **What do the functions `IsGTC()`, `IsFoK()`, `IsIoC()`, `IsJIT()`, and `IsGoodTil()` do?**

   These functions are methods of the `LimitOrderType` type and return a boolean value indicating whether the given `LimitOrderType` is of a specific type. For example, `IsGTC()` checks if the `LimitOrderType` is GOOD_TIL_CANCELLED, and `IsFoK()` checks if it is FILL_OR_KILL.

3. **What is the purpose of the `HasExpiration()` function?**

   The `HasExpiration()` function is a method of the `LimitOrderType` type that checks if the given `LimitOrderType` has an expiration time associated with it. It returns true if the `LimitOrderType` is either GOOD_TIL_TIME or JUST_IN_TIME, indicating that the order has an expiration time.
