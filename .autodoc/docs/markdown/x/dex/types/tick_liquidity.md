The code provided is part of a larger project and is located in the `duality` package under the `types` subpackage. The main purpose of this code is to provide utility methods for working with `TickLiquidity` objects, which represent liquidity in a financial market. The code focuses on two specific types of liquidity: `LimitOrderTranche` and `PoolReserves`. These methods should be avoided if possible, and it is recommended to deal with these liquidity types explicitly.

The `TickLiquidity` struct has a field `Liquidity` which is an interface and can hold either a `LimitOrderTranche` or a `PoolReserves` object. The two methods provided in this code, `TickIndex()` and `HasToken()`, are used to extract information from the `TickLiquidity` object based on the type of liquidity it contains.

1. `TickIndex()`: This method returns the tick index of the liquidity object. It uses a type switch to determine the type of liquidity contained in the `TickLiquidity` object and then returns the appropriate tick index. If the liquidity is of type `LimitOrderTranche`, it returns `liquidity.LimitOrderTranche.TickIndex`. If the liquidity is of type `PoolReserves`, it returns `liquidity.PoolReserves.TickIndex`. If the liquidity type is not valid, the method panics with an error message.

   Example usage:
   ```
   tickLiquidity := ... // some TickLiquidity object
   tickIndex := tickLiquidity.TickIndex()
   ```

2. `HasToken()`: This method checks if the liquidity object contains a token. Similar to the `TickIndex()` method, it uses a type switch to determine the type of liquidity contained in the `TickLiquidity` object and then returns a boolean value indicating whether the liquidity object has a token. If the liquidity is of type `LimitOrderTranche`, it returns `liquidity.LimitOrderTranche.HasTokenIn()`. If the liquidity is of type `PoolReserves`, it returns `liquidity.PoolReserves.HasToken()`. If the liquidity type is not valid, the method panics with an error message.

   Example usage:
   ```
   tickLiquidity := ... // some TickLiquidity object
   hasToken := tickLiquidity.HasToken()
   ```
These utility methods can be used in the larger project to work with `TickLiquidity` objects and extract relevant information based on the type of liquidity they contain.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What are the possible types of `TickLiquidity` and what do they represent?
   **Answer:** There are two possible types of `TickLiquidity`: `TickLiquidity_LimitOrderTranche` and `TickLiquidity_PoolReserves`. They represent different types of liquidity in the system, with `LimitOrderTranche` being a limit order tranche and `PoolReserves` being the pool reserves.

2. **Question:** Why is it recommended to avoid using these methods if possible?
   **Answer:** The comment in the code suggests that these methods should be avoided because it is generally better to deal with `LimitOrderTranche` or `PoolReserves` explicitly. This is likely because using these methods may lead to less readable or maintainable code, or because they may introduce unnecessary complexity.

3. **Question:** What happens if the `TickLiquidity` type is not one of the expected types?
   **Answer:** If the `TickLiquidity` type is not one of the expected types (`TickLiquidity_LimitOrderTranche` or `TickLiquidity_PoolReserves`), the code will panic with the message "Tick does not contain valid liqudityType". This is to ensure that the code fails fast in case of an unexpected type, making it easier to identify and fix the issue.
