The code in this file is part of the `duality` project and is responsible for handling price calculations and conversions between two tokens in a decentralized exchange (DEX). The main data structure used in this file is the `Price` struct, which represents a conversion factor between two tokens based on a relative tick index.

The `Price` struct has a single field, `RelativeTickIndex`, which is an int64 value. The tick index is used to calculate the conversion factor between two tokens using the formula `x * 1.0001^(-1 * RelativeTickIndex) = y`. The code provides several methods to create a new `Price` instance, such as `NewPrice` and `MustNewPrice`, which take a relative tick index as input and return a new `Price` instance or panic if an error occurs.

The `Price` struct also provides methods for performing arithmetic operations with the conversion factor, such as `MulInt`, `Mul`, and `Inv`. These methods allow users to multiply the conversion factor by an integer or decimal value, or to invert the conversion factor.

Additionally, the code provides utility functions for calculating the price for a swap between two tokens, given a tick index. The `CalcPrice0To1` and `CalcPrice1To0` functions take a tick index as input and return a new `Price` instance representing the conversion factor for a swap from token 0 to token 1 or from token 1 to token 0, respectively.

Finally, the `IsTickOutOfRange` function checks if a given tick index is within the allowed range of [-352437, 352437]. This range is chosen to ensure that price calculations have less than 1% error when using 18-digit decimal precision.

In the larger project, this code would be used to handle price calculations and conversions between tokens in a DEX, allowing users to perform swaps and other operations with accurate conversion rates.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `RelativeTickIndex` field in the `Price` struct?
   **Answer**: The `RelativeTickIndex` field represents a conversion factor for a token pair, such that `x * 1.0001^(-1 * RelativeTickIndex) = y`. It is used to calculate the price of a token swap between two tokens in the DEX.

2. **Question**: Why is there a `MustNewPrice` function in addition to the `NewPrice` function?
   **Answer**: The `MustNewPrice` function is a convenience function that wraps the `NewPrice` function. It panics if there is an error while creating a new `Price` instance, whereas the `NewPrice` function returns the error. This is useful when the developer is certain that the input will not cause an error and wants to avoid handling the error explicitly.

3. **Question**: Why is the `ToDec()` function not used for calculations when the tick is positive?
   **Answer**: The `ToDec()` function is not used for calculations when the tick is positive because it calculates the price using a manual inversion `1 / 1.0001^X`, which can be lossy. Instead, other methods like `Mul()` and `MulInt()` are used to perform calculations with better precision.
