The `types` package contains the `Price` struct and associated functions for calculating prices in the context of the duality project. The `Price` struct has a single field, `RelativeTickIndex`, which represents the tick index of a price. A tick is a unit of price movement in the duality project, and the `RelativeTickIndex` field allows for the calculation of prices relative to a given tick.

The `NewPrice` function creates a new `Price` struct with the given `RelativeTickIndex`. It returns an error if the tick index is outside the range of [-352437, 352437]. The `MustNewPrice` function is a helper function that panics if the `NewPrice` function returns an error.

The `MulInt` and `Mul` functions are used to multiply a `Price` by an integer or decimal value, respectively. The `Inv` function returns a new `Price` struct that is the inverse of the original `Price`. The `ToDec` function returns the `Price` as a decimal value.

The `CalcPrice0To1` and `CalcPrice1To0` functions calculate the price for a swap from token 0 to token 1 and from token 1 to token 0, respectively, given a tick index. The `MustCalcPrice0To1` and `MustCalcPrice1To0` functions are helper functions that panic if the corresponding `CalcPrice` function returns an error.

The `IsTickOutOfRange` function returns `true` if the given tick index is outside the range of [-352437, 352437].

Overall, the `types` package provides functionality for working with prices in the duality project. The `Price` struct and associated functions allow for the calculation of prices relative to a given tick, which is a key concept in the duality project. The `CalcPrice` functions are used to calculate prices for swaps between tokens, and the `IsTickOutOfRange` function is used to validate tick indices.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Price` struct and how is it used?
   
   The `Price` struct represents a conversion factor between two tokens in a trading pair. It is used to calculate prices for swaps between the two tokens.

2. What is the significance of the `MaxTickExp` constant and how is it used?
   
   The `MaxTickExp` constant represents the highest possible tick index that can be used to calculate a price with less than 1% error. It is used in the `IsTickOutOfRange` function to check if a given tick index is outside the valid range.

3. Why is there a `MustNewPrice` function and what does it do?
   
   The `MustNewPrice` function is a convenience function that creates a new `Price` struct and panics if there is an error. It is used to simplify error handling when creating a new `Price` struct.
