The code in this file defines a message type `MsgMultiHopSwap` for the duality project, which is used to perform a multi-hop swap operation. A multi-hop swap is a process where assets are exchanged through multiple intermediate assets to achieve the desired conversion. This can be useful in cases where a direct swap between two assets is not available or not efficient.

The `NewMsgMultiHopSwap` function is a constructor for creating a new `MsgMultiHopSwap` instance. It takes the following parameters:

- `creator`: The address of the user initiating the swap.
- `receiver`: The address of the user receiving the swapped assets.
- `routesArr`: A 2D array of strings representing the possible routes for the swap, where each route is an array of asset symbols.
- `amountIn`: The amount of input asset to be swapped.
- `exitLimitPrice`: The minimum acceptable price for the final asset in the swap.
- `pickBestRoute`: A boolean flag indicating whether to automatically pick the best route for the swap.

The `MsgMultiHopSwap` struct implements the `sdk.Msg` interface, which includes methods like `Route`, `Type`, `GetSigners`, `GetSignBytes`, and `ValidateBasic`. These methods are used by the Cosmos SDK to handle and process the message.

The `ValidateBasic` method checks if the message is valid by verifying the creator and receiver addresses, ensuring there is at least one route, and checking that all routes have the same exit token. It also checks if the input amount is greater than zero.

Here's an example of how to create a `MsgMultiHopSwap` instance:

```go
routes := [][]string{
	{"ATOM", "BTC", "ETH"},
	{"ATOM", "USDT", "ETH"},
}
msg := NewMsgMultiHopSwap(
	"cosmos1qy352eufqy352eufqy352eufqy35...",
	"cosmos1qy352eufqy352eufqy352eufqy35...",
	routes,
	sdk.NewInt(100),
	sdk.NewDecWithPrec(1, 2),
	true,
)
```

In the larger project, this message type would be used to initiate a multi-hop swap operation, which would be processed by the corresponding handler and eventually executed by the application's state machine.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `NewMsgMultiHopSwap` function and what are its input parameters?

   **Answer:** The `NewMsgMultiHopSwap` function is a constructor for creating a new `MsgMultiHopSwap` object. It takes the following input parameters: `creator` (string), `receiver` (string), `routesArr` (a 2D slice of strings), `amountIn` (sdk.Int), `exitLimitPrice` (sdk.Dec), and `pickBestRoute` (bool).

2. **Question:** How does the `ValidateBasic` function work and what are the possible errors it can return?

   **Answer:** The `ValidateBasic` function checks the validity of the `MsgMultiHopSwap` object by validating the creator and receiver addresses, ensuring there is at least one route, checking for exit token mismatches, and ensuring the input amount is greater than zero. It can return errors related to invalid addresses, missing multihop routes, exit token mismatches, or zero swap amounts.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `GetSigners` function and how does it work?

   **Answer:** The `GetSigners` function returns a slice of account addresses that are required to sign the message. In this case, it converts the `msg.Creator` string to an `sdk.AccAddress` and returns a slice containing only the creator's address. If there is an error in the conversion, it will panic.
