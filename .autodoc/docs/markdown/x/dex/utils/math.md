The `utils` package contains a set of utility functions that can be used across the `duality` project. The functions in this file are focused on providing basic math and conversion operations.

The `BasePrice` function returns a `sdk.Dec` value of 1.0001. This function is likely used as a default value for a price or exchange rate in the project.

The `Abs` function returns the absolute value of an `int64` as a `uint64`. This function can be used to ensure that a value is always positive, regardless of its original sign.

The `MaxInt64` and `MinInt64` functions return the maximum and minimum values between two `int64` values. These functions can be used to ensure that a value falls within a certain range.

The `MinDec` and `MaxDec` functions return the minimum and maximum values between two `sdk.Dec` values. These functions can be used to ensure that a decimal value falls within a certain range.

The `MinIntArr` and `MaxIntArr` functions return the minimum and maximum values in an array of `sdk.Int` values. These functions can be used to find the minimum and maximum values in a set of integers.

The `Uint64ToSortableString` function converts a `uint64` value to a string that sorts lexicographically in integer order. This function can be used to sort `uint64` values as strings.

The `SafeUint64` function converts a `uint64` value to an `int64` value and returns a boolean indicating whether an overflow occurred during the conversion. This function can be used to safely convert `uint64` values to `int64` values.

The `MustSafeUint64` function is similar to `SafeUint64`, but it panics if an overflow occurs during the conversion. This function can be used when an overflow is considered an exceptional case that should not occur during normal operation.

Overall, these utility functions provide basic math and conversion operations that can be used throughout the `duality` project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BasePrice` function?
   
   The `BasePrice` function returns a `sdk.Dec` value representing the base value for price, which is 1.0001.

2. What is the purpose of the `Uint64ToSortableString` function?
   
   The `Uint64ToSortableString` function converts a `uint64` value to a string that sorts lexicographically in integer order.

3. What is the purpose of the `SafeUint64` and `MustSafeUint64` functions?
   
   The `SafeUint64` function converts a `uint64` value to an `int64` value, and returns a boolean indicating whether an overflow occurred. The `MustSafeUint64` function is similar, but panics if an overflow occurs.
