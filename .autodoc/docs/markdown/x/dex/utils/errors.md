The `utils` package in this code snippet provides a utility function called `JoinErrors` that is used to combine multiple errors into a single error. This can be useful in situations where a function or operation encounters multiple errors, and it is necessary to return all of them to the caller for proper handling or logging.

The `JoinErrors` function takes two arguments: a `parentError` of type `error`, and a variadic parameter `errs` which is a slice of errors. The variadic parameter allows the function to accept any number of error arguments.

Inside the function, a new error called `fullError` is created using the `fmt.Errorf` function. The `parentError` is wrapped with a message "errors: %w" using the `%w` verb, which is a placeholder for the error argument. This verb is used to wrap errors so that they can be unwrapped later using the `errors.Unwrap` function.

Next, the function iterates through the `errs` slice using a `for` loop. For each error in the slice, the `fullError` is updated by wrapping the current error using the `%w` verb. This creates a chain of wrapped errors, with each error wrapping the previous one.

Finally, the `fullError` is returned to the caller. This error now contains all the input errors wrapped together, allowing the caller to handle or log them as needed.

Here's an example of how the `JoinErrors` function might be used in the larger project:

```go
func performOperations() error {
    err1 := operation1()
    err2 := operation2()
    err3 := operation3()

    if err1 != nil || err2 != nil || err3 != nil {
        return utils.JoinErrors(errors.New("operation errors"), err1, err2, err3)
    }

    return nil
}
```

In this example, if any of the operations return an error, the `JoinErrors` function is called to combine all the errors into a single error, which is then returned to the caller.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `JoinErrors` function?
   **Answer:** The `JoinErrors` function is used to combine multiple errors into a single error, with the `parentError` being the main error and the rest of the errors being appended to it.

2. **Question:** Why is there a TODO comment about switching to `errors.Join` when bumping to Golang 1.20?
   **Answer:** The TODO comment suggests that the current implementation of `JoinErrors` might be replaced with the `errors.Join` function when the project upgrades to Golang 1.20, as it might provide a more efficient or idiomatic way to join errors.

3. **Question:** How does the current implementation of `JoinErrors` handle the case when multiple errors are passed in the `errs` parameter?
   **Answer:** The current implementation iterates through the `errs` parameter and appends each error to the `fullError` variable using the `%w` verb in `fmt.Errorf`. However, it seems to overwrite the `fullError` in each iteration, which might not be the intended behavior for joining multiple errors.
