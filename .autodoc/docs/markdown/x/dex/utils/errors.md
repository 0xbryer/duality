The `JoinErrors` function in the `utils` package is designed to combine multiple errors into a single error message. This function takes in a parent error and a variable number of additional errors as arguments. It then creates a new error message that includes all of the errors passed in as arguments.

The function first creates a new error message using the `fmt.Errorf` function, which formats a string according to a format specifier and returns a new error message. In this case, the format specifier is "errors: %w", where `%w` is a special verb that indicates that the error message should include the error passed in as an argument. The parent error is passed in as the argument to this format specifier, so the resulting error message includes the parent error.

Next, the function loops through all of the additional errors passed in as arguments and adds them to the error message using the `%w` verb. Each error is added to the error message using the `fmt.Errorf` function, which creates a new error message that includes the error passed in as an argument.

Finally, the function returns the full error message, which includes all of the errors passed in as arguments. This error message can then be used to provide more detailed information about what went wrong in the code.

This function can be useful in the larger project for handling errors that occur in different parts of the code. By combining multiple errors into a single error message, it can be easier to understand what went wrong and where the error occurred. For example, if there are multiple errors that occur during a database query, this function can be used to combine all of those errors into a single error message that can be returned to the user. 

Here is an example of how this function might be used:

```
func doSomething() error {
    err1 := someFunction()
    err2 := anotherFunction()
    if err1 != nil || err2 != nil {
        return utils.JoinErrors(err1, err2)
    }
    return nil
}
```

In this example, `doSomething` calls two different functions that may return errors. If either of those functions returns an error, `JoinErrors` is called to combine the errors into a single error message that is returned to the caller.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `JoinErrors` function?
   - The `JoinErrors` function takes in a parent error and a variadic list of errors, and returns a new error that combines all of the input errors into one error message.
2. Why is there a TODO comment referencing `errors.Join`?
   - The TODO comment suggests that the `JoinErrors` function should eventually be updated to use the `errors.Join` function instead, which is a built-in function in Go 1.20 that simplifies error concatenation.
3. What does the `%w` verb in the `fmt.Errorf` calls do?
   - The `%w` verb is used to wrap an error with additional context, allowing the error to be unwrapped later using the `errors.Unwrap` function. In this case, it is used to add the parent error and each individual error to the final error message.
