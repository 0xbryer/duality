The `utils` package in the `duality` project provides a set of utility functions that can be used across the project. These functions are focused on error handling, basic math, and conversion operations.

In `errors.go`, the `JoinErrors` function combines multiple errors into a single error message. This is useful for handling errors that occur in different parts of the code, making it easier to understand what went wrong and where the error occurred. For example:

```go
func doSomething() error {
    err1 := someFunction()
    err2 := anotherFunction()
    if err1 != nil || err2 != nil {
        return utils.JoinErrors(err1, err2)
    }
    return nil
}
```

In this example, `doSomething` calls two different functions that may return errors. If either of those functions returns an error, `JoinErrors` is called to combine the errors into a single error message that is returned to the caller.

In `math.go`, various utility functions provide basic math and conversion operations. Functions like `Abs`, `MaxInt64`, `MinInt64`, `MinDec`, `MaxDec`, `MinIntArr`, and `MaxIntArr` are used to perform operations on integers and decimals, ensuring that values fall within a certain range or are always positive.

The `Uint64ToSortableString` function converts a `uint64` value to a string that sorts lexicographically in integer order, which can be useful for sorting `uint64` values as strings.

The `SafeUint64` and `MustSafeUint64` functions are used to safely convert `uint64` values to `int64` values, with the latter panicking if an overflow occurs during the conversion. These functions can be used when handling conversions between different integer types.

Overall, the utility functions in this package provide essential operations that can be used throughout the `duality` project, ensuring consistent error handling, math operations, and conversions.
