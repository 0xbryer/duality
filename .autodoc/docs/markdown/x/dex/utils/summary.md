The `utils` package in the `dex` folder provides utility functions for the duality project, focusing on error handling and mathematical operations. These functions are designed to work with the Cosmos SDK, a framework for building blockchain applications in Golang.

`errors.go` contains a utility function called `JoinErrors` that combines multiple errors into a single error. This is useful when a function encounters multiple errors and needs to return all of them to the caller for proper handling or logging. For example:

```go
func performOperations() error {
    err1 := operation1()
    err2 := operation2()
    err3 := operation3()

    if err1 != nil || err2 != nil || err3 != nil {
        return utils.JoinErrors(errors.New("operation errors"), err1, err2, err3)
    }

    return nil
}
```

In this example, if any of the operations return an error, the `JoinErrors` function is called to combine all the errors into a single error, which is then returned to the caller.

`math.go` provides utility functions for mathematical operations and conversions, such as:

1. `BasePrice()`: Returns the base value for price as a decimal, which is 1.0001.
2. `Abs(x int64)`: Calculates the absolute value of an int64 input and returns it as a uint64.
3. `MaxInt64(a, b int64)` and `MinInt64(a, b int64)`: Return the maximum and minimum values, respectively, between two int64 inputs.
4. `MinDec(a, b sdk.Dec)` and `MaxDec(a, b sdk.Dec)`: Return the minimum and maximum values, respectively, between two sdk.Dec (decimal) inputs.
5. `MinIntArr(vals []sdk.Int)` and `MaxIntArr(vals []sdk.Int)`: Return the minimum and maximum values, respectively, from an array of sdk.Int inputs.
6. `Uint64ToSortableString(i uint64)`: Converts a uint64 input to a string that sorts lexicographically in integer order.
7. `SafeUint64(in uint64)` and `MustSafeUint64(in uint64)`: Safely convert a uint64 input to an int64 output.

These utility functions can be used throughout the duality project to perform common mathematical operations and conversions, ensuring consistency and reducing the need for repetitive code. For example, when comparing two prices in the project, one can use the `MaxDec` and `MinDec` functions to easily determine the higher and lower prices:

```go
price1 := sdk.NewDec(100)
price2 := sdk.NewDec(200)

maxPrice := utils.MaxDec(price1, price2)
minPrice := utils.MinDec(price1, price2)
```

In summary, the `utils` package in the `dex` folder provides essential utility functions for error handling and mathematical operations, which can be used throughout the duality project to ensure consistency and reduce code repetition.
