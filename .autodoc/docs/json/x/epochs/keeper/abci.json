  "summary": "The `BeginBlocker` function in the `keeper` package of the `duality` project is responsible for managing epochs. An epoch is a period of time during which certain actions can be taken in the system. The purpose of this function is to determine when a new epoch should begin and to perform the necessary actions to start it.\n\nThe function starts by iterating over all the epoch information stored in the system. For each epoch, it checks whether the current block time is after the epoch start time. If it is not, the function returns and does nothing. If it is, the function checks whether epoch counting has started. If it has not, the function signals that it needs to start. The function then calculates the end time of the current epoch and checks whether the current block time is after that end time or if epoch counting needs to start. If neither of these conditions is true, the function returns and does nothing.\n\nIf a new epoch needs to start, the function sets the current epoch start height to the current block height. If epoch counting needs to start, the function sets the epoch counting started flag to true, sets the current epoch to 1, and sets the current epoch start time to the epoch start time. If epoch counting has already started, the function emits an event indicating the end of the previous epoch, performs any necessary actions after the epoch ends, increments the current epoch, sets the current epoch start time to the end time of the previous epoch, and emits an event indicating the start of the new epoch. Finally, the function sets the epoch information in the system and performs any necessary actions before the epoch starts.\n\nThis function is a critical part of the `duality` project as it manages the timing of epochs, which is essential for the proper functioning of the system. Other parts of the system can use the epoch information stored in the system to determine when certain actions can be taken. For example, a smart contract might use the epoch information to determine when it can be executed. The `BeginBlocker` function can be called by other parts of the system to start a new epoch manually if necessary.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `BeginBlocker` function in the epochs module?\n- The `BeginBlocker` function is a method of the `Keeper` struct in the epochs module that is called at the beginning of each block. It iterates through all epoch info and starts a new epoch if necessary.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `shouldInitialEpochStart` variable?\n- The `shouldInitialEpochStart` variable is a boolean that is set to true if epoch counting has not yet started. It is used to determine whether a new epoch should be started or not.\n\n3. What events are emitted when a new epoch starts or ends?\n- When a new epoch starts, the `BeginBlocker` function emits an event of type `EventTypeEpochStart` with attributes `AttributeEpochNumber` and `AttributeEpochStartTime`. When an epoch ends, the function emits an event of type `EventTypeEpochEnd` with attribute `AttributeEpochNumber`."
