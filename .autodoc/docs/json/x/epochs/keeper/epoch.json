  "summary": "The `keeper` package contains the implementation of the `Keeper` struct, which is responsible for managing the state of the `EpochInfo` objects in the `duality` project. The `EpochInfo` object contains information about an epoch, such as its start time and identifier. The `Keeper` struct provides methods for adding, retrieving, and deleting `EpochInfo` objects, as well as iterating through all the epochs.\n\nThe `GetEpochInfo` method retrieves an `EpochInfo` object by its identifier. It takes a `sdk.Context` object and a string identifier as input and returns an `EpochInfo` object. If the identifier is not found, it returns an empty `EpochInfo` object.\n\nThe `AddEpochInfo` method adds a new `EpochInfo` object to the state. It takes a `sdk.Context` object and an `EpochInfo` object as input and returns an error if the epoch fails validation or if the identifier already exists. If the start time is not set, it sets it to the current block time. It also sets the epoch start height.\n\nThe `setEpochInfo` method sets an `EpochInfo` object in the state. It takes a `sdk.Context` object and an `EpochInfo` object as input and does not return anything.\n\nThe `DeleteEpochInfo` method deletes an `EpochInfo` object from the state. It takes a `sdk.Context` object and a string identifier as input and does not return anything.\n\nThe `IterateEpochInfo` method iterates through all the `EpochInfo` objects in the state. It takes a `sdk.Context` object and a function as input. The function takes an index and an `EpochInfo` object as input and returns a boolean value. If the boolean value is true, the iteration stops. Otherwise, it continues.\n\nThe `AllEpochInfos` method returns all the `EpochInfo` objects in the state. It takes a `sdk.Context` object as input and returns a slice of `EpochInfo` objects.\n\nThe `NumBlocksSinceEpochStart` method returns the number of blocks since the epoch started. It takes a `sdk.Context` object and a string identifier as input and returns an integer value. If the identifier is not found, it returns an error.\n\nOverall, the `keeper` package provides a way to manage the state of the `EpochInfo` objects in the `duality` project. It allows for adding, retrieving, and deleting `EpochInfo` objects, as well as iterating through all the epochs and getting the number of blocks since the epoch started. This package is likely used in conjunction with other packages in the project to manage the overall state of the system.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `duality-labs/duality/x/epochs/types` package?\n- The `duality-labs/duality/x/epochs/types` package is used to define the data types related to epochs.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `AddEpochInfo` function?\n- The `AddEpochInfo` function is used to add a new epoch info to the store. It also sets the start time if left unset, and sets the epoch start height.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `IterateEpochInfo` function?\n- The `IterateEpochInfo` function is used to iterate through the epochs in the store and execute a function on each epoch."
