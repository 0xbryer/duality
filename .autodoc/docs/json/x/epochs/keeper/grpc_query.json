  "summary": "The code in this file is a part of the duality project and is located in the `keeper` package. The purpose of this code is to define a gRPC query server for the `x/epochs` module of the duality project. The `Querier` struct is defined as a wrapper around the `Keeper` struct of the `x/epochs` module, which provides gRPC method handlers. The `Keeper` struct is responsible for managing the state of the `x/epochs` module.\n\nThe `NewQuerier` function initializes a new `Querier` struct with the provided `Keeper` struct. The `EpochInfos` method provides running epoch information by calling the `AllEpochInfos` method of the `Keeper` struct. The `CurrentEpoch` method provides the current epoch of a specified identifier by calling the `GetEpochInfo` method of the `Keeper` struct.\n\nThis code is used to provide a gRPC interface for querying epoch information in the duality project. The `EpochInfos` method can be used to retrieve information about all running epochs, while the `CurrentEpoch` method can be used to retrieve information about a specific epoch. This code is an important part of the duality project as it allows external clients to query epoch information in a standardized way. \n\nExample usage of the `EpochInfos` method:\n```\nconn, err := grpc.Dial(address, grpc.WithInsecure())\nif err != nil {\n    log.Fatalf(\"Failed to dial: %v\", err)\n}\ndefer conn.Close()\n\nclient := types.NewQueryClient(conn)\n\nresp, err := client.EpochInfos(context.Background(), &types.QueryEpochsInfoRequest{})\nif err != nil {\n    log.Fatalf(\"Failed to query epoch infos: %v\", err)\n}\n\nfor _, epoch := range resp.Epochs {\n    fmt.Printf(\"Epoch %s started at %s\\n\", epoch.Identifier, epoch.StartTime)\n}\n```\n\nExample usage of the `CurrentEpoch` method:\n```\nconn, err := grpc.Dial(address, grpc.WithInsecure())\nif err != nil {\n    log.Fatalf(\"Failed to dial: %v\", err)\n}\ndefer conn.Close()\n\nclient := types.NewQueryClient(conn)\n\nresp, err := client.CurrentEpoch(context.Background(), &types.QueryCurrentEpochRequest{Identifier: \"epoch-1\"})\nif err != nil {\n    log.Fatalf(\"Failed to query current epoch: %v\", err)\n}\n\nfmt.Printf(\"Current epoch of epoch-1 is %d\\n\", resp.CurrentEpoch)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file is a part of the `duality` project and defines a gRPC method handler for querying epoch information.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code file have?\n- This code file imports several packages, including `cosmos-sdk/types`, `google.golang.org/grpc/codes`, and `google.golang.org/grpc/status`.\n\n3. What functionality does this code file provide?\n- This code file provides two gRPC method handlers: `EpochInfos` which returns running epochInfos, and `CurrentEpoch` which returns the current epoch of a specified identifier."
