      "summary": "The `epochs` module is designed to allow other modules in the SDK to run certain code periodically. It creates a generalized epoch interface that other modules can use to signal events at specified intervals. For example, another module can specify that it wants to execute code once a week, starting at a specific UTC time. The `epochs` module contains functionality for querying epoch, events for BeginBlock and EndBlock, and initialization for epoch-related information.\n\nThe `epochs` module is implemented as a Go package and contains two structs: `AppModuleBasic` and `AppModule`. `AppModuleBasic` implements the `AppModuleBasic` interface for the capability module. It contains methods for registering the module's Amino codec, registering the module's interface types, returning the module's default genesis state, validating the module's genesis state, registering the module's REST service handlers, registering the gRPC Gateway routes for the module, and returning the module's root query command. `AppModule` implements the `AppModule` interface for the capability module. It contains methods for registering the module's query server, initializing the module's genesis state, exporting the module's genesis state, executing all ABCI BeginBlock logic respective to the capability module, executing all ABCI EndBlock logic respective to the capability module, and returning the module's consensus version.\n\nThe `epochs` module is used in the larger project to allow other modules to run code periodically.

For example, a module that needs to execute code once a week can use the `epochs` module to specify the time and interval at which the code should be executed.

The `Querier` struct wraps around the `Keeper` struct and provides gRPC method handlers for retrieving running epoch information and the current epoch of a specified identifier.\n\nThe `hooks.go` file defines two functions, `AfterEpochEnd` and `BeforeEpochStart`, which are called at the end and start of an epoch, respectively. Developers can define their own hook functions and register them with the `hooks` object to perform custom actions at the start or end of an epoch.\n\nThe `keeper.go` file provides the implementation of the `Keeper` struct, which is responsible for managing the state of the `epochs` module. It contains methods for initializing a new `Keeper` instance, setting hooks for the `epochs` module, and getting a logger instance for the `epochs` module.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `Keeper` struct to add a new `EpochInfo` object:\n\n```go\nk := keeper.NewKeeper(storeKey)\nepochInfo := types.EpochInfo{\n    Identifier: \"epoch-1\",\n    StartTime:  time.Now(),\n}\nerr := k.AddEpochInfo(ctx, epochInfo)\nif err != nil {\n    log.Fatalf(\"Failed to add epoch info: %v\", err)\n}\n```\n\nOverall, the `keeper` package plays a crucial role in the `duality` project by managing the state of the `epochs` module, which is essential for the proper functioning of the system. Other parts of the system can use the epoch information stored in the system to determine when certain actions can be taken, such as executing a smart contract.",
