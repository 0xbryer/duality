  "summary": "The `types` package in the `duality` project is responsible for translating gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) into RESTful JSON APIs. This package provides a way to convert data between these two different communication protocols. \n\nThe purpose of this package is to allow developers to use gRPC for internal communication within their application, while still providing a RESTful API for external clients to interact with. This can be useful in situations where different parts of an application need to communicate with each other using a more efficient protocol like gRPC, but external clients may not have the ability to use gRPC and require a RESTful API.\n\nThe `types` package contains functions and structs that are used to convert data between gRPC and RESTful JSON formats. For example, the `FromGRPCMessage` function takes in a gRPC message and returns a JSON object, while the `ToGRPCMessage` function takes in a JSON object and returns a gRPC message. \n\nHere is an example of how this package may be used in the larger project:\n\n```go\nimport (\n    \"github.com/duality/types\"\n    \"google.golang.org/grpc\"\n)\n\n// Create a gRPC server\ngrpcServer := grpc.NewServer()\n\n// Register a gRPC service\nmyService := &MyService{}\npb.RegisterMyServiceServer(grpcServer, myService)\n\n// Create a RESTful API server\napiServer := &http.Server{\n    Addr:    \":8080\",\n    Handler: types.NewAPIHandler(grpcServer),\n}\n\n// Start both servers\ngo grpcServer.Serve(lis)\ngo apiServer.ListenAndServe()\n```\n\nIn this example, a gRPC server is created and a gRPC service is registered. Then, a RESTful API server is created using the `NewAPIHandler` function from the `types` package, which takes in the gRPC server as a parameter. Finally, both servers are started concurrently. \n\nOverall, the `types` package in the `duality` project provides a way to bridge the gap between gRPC and RESTful JSON APIs, allowing for more efficient internal communication while still providing a user-friendly external API.",
