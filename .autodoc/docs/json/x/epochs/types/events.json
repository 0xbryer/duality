  "summary": "The code above defines a set of constants that are used to represent event types and attributes in the duality project. The `EventTypeEpochEnd` and `EventTypeEpochStart` constants represent the end and start of an epoch, respectively. An epoch is a period of time in the project that is used for various purposes such as data analysis and model training. \n\nThe `AttributeEpochNumber` constant represents the number of the epoch, while the `AttributeEpochStartTime` constant represents the start time of the epoch. These attributes are used to provide additional information about the epoch, such as when it started and how many epochs have been completed.\n\nThese constants are used throughout the duality project to ensure consistency in the representation of events and their associated attributes. For example, when an epoch ends, an event with the type `EventTypeEpochEnd` is created and includes the attributes `AttributeEpochNumber` and `AttributeEpochStartTime`. This allows other parts of the project to easily access and analyze this information.\n\nHere is an example of how these constants might be used in the duality project:\n\n```\nimport \"github.com/duality/types\"\n\nfunc endEpoch(epochNumber int, startTime time.Time) {\n    event := types.Event{\n        Type: types.EventTypeEpochEnd,\n        Attributes: map[string]interface{}{\n            types.AttributeEpochNumber: epochNumber,\n            types.AttributeEpochStartTime: startTime,\n        },\n    }\n    // send event to event bus for processing\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `endEpoch` function creates an event with the type `EventTypeEpochEnd` and includes the epoch number and start time as attributes. The event is then sent to an event bus for processing by other parts of the project.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\\\nA smart developer might want to know what this code is used for and how it fits into the overall functionality of the `duality` project. Based on the package name (`types`), it is likely that this code defines some custom types or constants used throughout the project.\n\n2. **What are the `EventTypeEpochEnd` and `EventTypeEpochStart` constants used for?**\\\nA smart developer might want to know how these constants are used and what events they correspond to. Based on their names, it is likely that they are used to signal the end and start of an epoch, respectively.\n\n3. **What are the `AttributeEpochNumber` and `AttributeEpochStartTime` attributes used for?**\\\nA smart developer might want to know how these attributes are used and what information they store. Based on their names, it is likely that they are used to store the number and start time of an epoch, respectively."
