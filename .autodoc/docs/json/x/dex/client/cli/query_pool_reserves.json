  "summary": "The `cli` package contains two Cobra commands that allow users to query the reserves of a liquidity pool in the Duality blockchain. The first command, `CmdListPoolReserves`, queries all the reserves of a pool for a specific token. The second command, `CmdShowPoolReserves`, queries the reserves of a pool for a specific token, tick index, and fee.\n\nBoth commands use the `cosmos-sdk` and `duality-labs` packages to interact with the Duality blockchain. The `CmdListPoolReserves` command takes two arguments: `pair-id` and `token-in`. The `pair-id` argument is a string that represents the ID of the pool pair, and the `token-in` argument is a string that represents the token for which the reserves are being queried. The command returns a `QueryAllPoolReservesResponse` object that contains the reserves for the specified token.\n\nThe `CmdShowPoolReserves` command takes four arguments: `pair-id`, `tick-index`, `token-in`, and `fee`. The `pair-id` argument is a string that represents the ID of the pool pair, the `tick-index` argument is an integer that represents the tick index of the pool, the `token-in` argument is a string that represents the token for which the reserves are being queried, and the `fee` argument is an integer that represents the fee for the pool. The command returns a `QueryGetPoolReservesResponse` object that contains the reserves for the specified token, tick index, and fee.\n\nBoth commands use the `cosmos-sdk` package to interact with the Duality blockchain. The `flags` package is used to add query flags to the commands. The `cobra` package is used to create the commands and handle their execution.\n\nExample usage of `CmdListPoolReserves`:\n```\n$ dualitycli list-pool-reserves tokenA<>tokenB tokenA\n```\n\nExample usage of `CmdShowPoolReserves`:\n```\n$ dualitycli show-pool-reserves tokenA<>tokenB [-5] tokenA 1\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines two Cobra commands for querying pool reserves in the Duality decentralized exchange (DEX).\n\n2. What arguments do these commands take?\n- The `list-pool-reserves` command takes two arguments: a pair ID and a token in. The `show-pool-reserves` command takes four arguments: a pair ID, a tick index, a token in, and a fee.\n\n3. What external packages are imported and used in this code?\n- This code imports and uses several packages from the Cosmos SDK and Duality Labs, including `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/client`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/client/flags`, and `github.com/duality-labs/duality/x/dex/types`."
