  "summary": "The code above is a part of the duality project and is located in the `cli` package. The purpose of this code is to define the command-line interface (CLI) query commands for the `dex` module of the duality project. \n\nThe `GetQueryCmd` function returns a `cobra.Command` object that groups all the dex queries under a subcommand. The `cmd` object has several subcommands added to it using the `AddCommand` method. Each subcommand corresponds to a specific query that can be executed using the CLI. \n\nFor example, the `CmdQueryParams` subcommand returns the current parameters of the dex module. The `CmdListLimitOrderTrancheUser` subcommand lists all the limit orders for a specific user in a specific tranche. The `CmdShowLimitOrderTrancheUser` subcommand shows a specific limit order for a specific user in a specific tranche. \n\nOther subcommands include `CmdListLimitOrderTranche`, `CmdShowLimitOrderTranche`, `CmdShowUserPositions`, `CmdListUserDeposits`, `CmdListUserLimitOrders`, `CmdListTickLiquidity`, `CmdListInactiveLimitOrderTranche`, `CmdShowInactiveLimitOrderTranche`, `CmdListPoolReserves`, and `CmdShowPoolReserves`. \n\nThese subcommands allow users to query various aspects of the dex module, such as limit orders, user positions, and pool reserves. The CLI provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the dex module and retrieving information about its state. \n\nOverall, this code plays an important role in the duality project by providing a user-friendly way to query the dex module. It allows users to retrieve important information about the state of the module and make informed decisions based on that information.",
