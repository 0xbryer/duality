  "summary": "The `keeper` package contains the implementation of the `Keeper` struct, which is responsible for managing the state of the duality blockchain. This package provides functions for setting, getting, and removing pool reserves from the blockchain.\n\nThe `SetPoolReserves` function takes a `PoolReserves` object and stores it in the blockchain. The `PoolReserves` object contains information about the reserves of a liquidity pool, such as the pair ID, token in, tick index, fee, and the amount of tokens in the pool. The function first wraps the `PoolReserves` object into a `TickLiquidity` object and then marshals it into bytes using the `cdc.MustMarshal` function. It then stores the bytes in the blockchain using the `prefix.NewStore` function and the `store.Set` function.\n\nThe `GetPoolReserves` function retrieves a `PoolReserves` object from the blockchain based on the pair ID, token in, tick index, fee, and returns it if it exists. The function first retrieves the bytes from the blockchain using the `prefix.NewStore` function and the `store.Get` function. It then unmarshals the bytes into a `TickLiquidity` object using the `cdc.MustUnmarshal` function and returns the `PoolReserves` object from the `TickLiquidity` object.\n\nThe `RemovePoolReserves` function removes a `PoolReserves` object from the blockchain based on the pair ID, token in, tick index, fee. The function first retrieves the bytes from the blockchain using the `prefix.NewStore` function and the `store.Delete` function.\n\nThese functions are used to manage the state of the duality blockchain by storing and retrieving information about the reserves of liquidity pools. Other parts of the duality project can use these functions to interact with the blockchain and retrieve information about the state of the liquidity pools. For example, a user interface can use the `GetPoolReserves` function to display the current reserves of a liquidity pool to the user.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `duality-labs/duality/x/dex/types` package?\n   - The `duality-labs/duality/x/dex/types` package is used in this code to define the `PoolReserves` and `TickLiquidity` types.\n2. What is the significance of the `TickLiquidityKeyPrefix` constant?\n   - The `TickLiquidityKeyPrefix` constant is used to create a prefix for the keys in the key-value store that this code interacts with.\n3. What happens if `GetPoolReserves` is called with a non-existent key?\n   - If `GetPoolReserves` is called with a non-existent key, it will return `nil` for the `pool` value and `false` for the `found` boolean."
