  "summary": "The `keeper` package contains the implementation of the `Keeper` struct, which is responsible for managing the state of the `duality` project. The `HopsToRouteData` function takes a list of tokens and an exit limit price as input and returns a list of `MultihopStep` structs. Each `MultihopStep` struct contains the best price and the trading pair for a given pair of tokens. The function calculates the best price for each pair of tokens by calling the `GetCurrPrice0To1` or `GetCurrPrice1To0` function of the `Keeper` struct, depending on the order of the tokens in the pair. If the best price cannot be found, the function returns an error. The function also calculates the price upper bound by multiplying the best prices of all pairs of tokens.\n\nThe `CalcMultihopPriceUpperbound` function takes the current price and a list of `MultihopStep` structs as input and returns the price upper bound for the remaining steps in the list. The function calculates the price upper bound by multiplying the best prices of all remaining pairs of tokens.\n\nThe `MultihopStep` function takes a `BranchableCache` object, a `MultihopStep` struct, an input coin, an exit limit price, the current price, a list of remaining `MultihopStep` structs, and a step cache as input and returns an output coin, a `BranchableCache` object, and an error. The function calculates the output coin by calling the `SwapExactAmountIn` function of the `Keeper` struct with the input coin and the trading pair of the `MultihopStep` struct. The function also checks if the exit limit price is greater than the price upper bound for the remaining steps in the list. If the exit limit price is greater, the function returns an error. The function uses the step cache to store the result of the calculation for a given input coin and trading pair.\n\nThe `RunMultihopRoute` function takes a context, a `MultiHopRoute` struct, an initial input coin, an exit limit price, and a step cache as input and returns an output coin, a function to write the cache to the context, and an error. The function calculates the list of `MultihopStep` structs by calling the `HopsToRouteData` function. The function then iterates over the list of `MultihopStep` structs and calls the `MultihopStep` function for each step. The function also updates the current price for each step. If the exit limit price is greater than the current price, the function returns an error. The function uses the step cache to store the result of the calculation for each step.\n\nOverall, these functions provide the functionality to calculate the best price and the output coin for a given list of tokens and an input coin. The `RunMultihopRoute` function can be used to execute a multi-hop trade by calling the `MultihopStep` function for each step in the list of `MultihopStep` structs. The step cache is used to store the result of the calculation for each step, which can improve the performance of the function by avoiding redundant calculations.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `HopsToRouteData` function?\n- The `HopsToRouteData` function takes in a list of token pairs and an exit limit price, and returns an array of `MultihopStep` structs that represent the best trading pair and price for each hop in the route.\n2. What is the purpose of the `MultihopStep` struct?\n- The `MultihopStep` struct represents a single hop in a multi-hop trade, and contains information about the best trading pair and price for that hop.\n3. What is the purpose of the `RunMultihopRoute` function?\n- The `RunMultihopRoute` function takes in a multi-hop route, an initial input coin, an exit limit price, and a step cache, and executes the multi-hop trade by calling `MultihopStep` for each hop in the route. It returns the final output coin, a function to write the branchable cache, and an error if the trade fails."
