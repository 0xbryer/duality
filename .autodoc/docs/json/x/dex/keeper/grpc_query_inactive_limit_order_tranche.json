  "summary": "The `keeper` package contains the implementation of the `Keeper` struct, which is responsible for managing the state of the `duality` project. This file contains two methods that deal with inactive limit order tranches.\n\nThe `InactiveLimitOrderTrancheAll` method returns all inactive limit order tranches stored in the state. It takes a context and a request object as input and returns a response object and an error. The request object contains pagination information. The method first checks if the request object is valid. Then it creates a new context from the input context and gets the KV store from the `Keeper` struct. It creates a new prefix store for inactive limit order tranches and uses the `Paginate` function from the `query` package to iterate over the store and retrieve all the inactive limit order tranches. It appends each inactive limit order tranche to a slice and returns the slice along with the pagination information in the response object.\n\nThe `InactiveLimitOrderTranche` method returns a specific inactive limit order tranche stored in the state. It takes a context and a request object as input and returns a response object and an error. The request object contains the pair ID, token in, tick index, and tranche key of the inactive limit order tranche to retrieve. The method first checks if the request object is valid. Then it creates a new context from the input context and converts the pair ID from a string to a `PairID` type. It calls the `GetInactiveLimitOrderTranche` method from the `Keeper` struct to retrieve the inactive limit order tranche from the state. If the inactive limit order tranche is not found, it returns an error. Otherwise, it returns the inactive limit order tranche in the response object.\n\nThese methods can be used to retrieve inactive limit order tranches from the state. The `InactiveLimitOrderTrancheAll` method can be used to retrieve all inactive limit order tranches, while the `InactiveLimitOrderTranche` method can be used to retrieve a specific inactive limit order tranche. These methods can be called by other parts of the `duality` project that need to access inactive limit order tranches.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n   \n   This code is part of the `duality` project and defines two functions for querying inactive limit order tranches. The first function returns all inactive limit order tranches, while the second function returns a specific inactive limit order tranche based on the provided parameters.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n   \n   This code imports several packages from external dependencies, including `cosmos-sdk`, `grpc`, and `duality-labs/duality/x/dex/types`. \n\n3. What is the expected input and output of the two functions defined in this code?\n   \n   The first function, `InactiveLimitOrderTrancheAll`, takes a context and a request object as input and returns a response object and an error. The second function, `InactiveLimitOrderTranche`, takes a context and a request object as input and returns a response object and an error. Both functions are expected to interact with a key-value store and return data related to inactive limit order tranches."
