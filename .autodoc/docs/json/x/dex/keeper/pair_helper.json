  "summary": "The `keeper` package contains several functions that are used in the `duality` project for sorting tokens, creating pair IDs, and normalizing tick indexes. \n\nThe `SortTokens` function takes two token strings as input and returns them in sorted order. If the tokens are the same, an error is returned. This function is used to ensure that trading pairs are always sorted in a consistent manner.\n\nThe `SortAmounts` function takes two token strings and two slices of `sdk.Int` as input. It returns the two slices in the order specified by the tokens. If the tokens are the same, the original order is returned. This function is used to ensure that the amounts of tokens being traded are sorted in the same order as the trading pair.\n\nThe `CreatePairID` function takes two token strings as input and returns a pointer to a `PairID` struct. This struct contains the two tokens that make up the trading pair. This function is used to create a unique identifier for each trading pair.\n\nThe `CreatePairIDFromUnsorted` function takes two token strings as input and returns a pointer to a `PairID` struct. This function first sorts the tokens using the `SortTokens` function and then calls `CreatePairID` to create the pair ID. This function is used to create a pair ID from two tokens that may not be sorted.\n\nThe `GetInOutTokens` function takes three token strings as input and returns the input token and the output token. If the input token is the same as the first token, the output token is the second token. Otherwise, the output token is the first token. This function is used to determine which token is being traded in and which token is being traded out.\n\nThe `NormalizeTickIndex` function takes three inputs: a base token, a token, and a tick index. It returns the tick index normalized based on the relationship between the base token and the token. If the tokens are the same, the tick index is returned unchanged. Otherwise, the tick index is negated. This function is used to ensure that tick indexes are consistent across different trading pairs.\n\nThe `NormalizeAllTickIndexes` function takes three inputs: a base token, a token, and a slice of tick indexes. It returns a new slice of tick indexes that have been normalized using the `NormalizeTickIndex` function. This function is used to normalize tick indexes for all trading pairs in a given context.\n\nOverall, these functions are used to ensure consistency and accuracy in the trading of tokens within the `duality` project. They are used to create unique identifiers for trading pairs, sort tokens and amounts, and normalize tick indexes.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code provides utility functions for sorting tokens and amounts, creating pair IDs, getting input and output tokens, and normalizing tick indexes. It is likely used in a decentralized exchange (DEX) implementation to facilitate trading between different tokens.\n\n2. What are the input and output types for each function?\n- `SortTokens` takes two strings as input and returns two strings and an error. \n- `SortAmounts` takes two strings and two slices of `sdk.Int` as input and returns two slices of `sdk.Int`. \n- `CreatePairID` takes two strings as input and returns a pointer to a `types.PairID`. \n- `CreatePairIDFromUnsorted` takes two strings as input and returns a pointer to a `types.PairID` and an error. \n- `GetInOutTokens` takes three strings as input and returns two strings. \n- `NormalizeTickIndex` takes three strings and an integer as input and returns an integer. \n- `NormalizeAllTickIndexes` takes three strings and a slice of integers as input and returns a slice of integers.\n\n3. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code imports three packages from the Cosmos SDK (`sdk`, `sdkerrors`, and `github.com/duality-labs/duality/x/dex/types`). It is likely that the DEX implementation using this code is built on top of the Cosmos SDK."
