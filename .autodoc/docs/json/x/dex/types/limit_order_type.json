  "summary": "The code above defines a set of methods for the `LimitOrderType` type, which is likely a part of a larger project called `duality`. These methods are used to determine the properties of different types of limit orders in a trading system.\n\nThe `IsGTC()` method checks if a given limit order is a \"good-til-cancelled\" order. This means that the order will remain active until it is either filled or cancelled by the user.\n\nThe `IsFoK()` method checks if a given limit order is a \"fill-or-kill\" order. This means that the order must be filled immediately and completely, or it will be cancelled.\n\nThe `IsIoC()` method checks if a given limit order is an \"immediate-or-cancel\" order. This means that the order must be filled immediately, and any unfilled portion will be cancelled.\n\nThe `IsJIT()` method checks if a given limit order is a \"just-in-time\" order. This means that the order will be executed as soon as possible, but no later than a specified time.\n\nThe `IsGoodTil()` method checks if a given limit order is a \"good-til-time\" order. This means that the order will remain active until a specified time, after which it will be cancelled.\n\nThe `HasExpiration()` method checks if a given limit order has an expiration time. This is true if the order is either a \"good-til-time\" order or a \"just-in-time\" order.\n\nThese methods can be used by other parts of the trading system to determine the properties of different types of limit orders. For example, a user interface could use these methods to display information about the different types of orders available to the user. Additionally, the trading engine could use these methods to validate orders and ensure that they are executed correctly. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\norderType := LimitOrderType_GOOD_TIL_CANCELLED\nisGTC := orderType.IsGTC() // true\nhasExpiration := orderType.HasExpiration() // false\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is `LimitOrderType` and where is it defined?\n- `LimitOrderType` is a type that is not defined in this code file. A smart developer might want to look for its definition in other files or packages within the `duality` project.\n\n2. What do the abbreviations GTC, FoK, IoC, and JIT stand for?\n- A smart developer might want to know the full names of these abbreviations to better understand the purpose of the functions. GTC stands for \"Good Til Cancelled\", FoK stands for \"Fill or Kill\", IoC stands for \"Immediate or Cancel\", and JIT stands for \"Just In Time\".\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `HasExpiration()` function?\n- The `HasExpiration()` function returns a boolean value indicating whether a `LimitOrderType` has an expiration time. A smart developer might want to know why this function is useful and how it is used in the context of the `duality` project."
