      "summary": "The `utils` package in this code snippet provides a utility function called `JoinErrors` that is used to combine multiple errors into a single error. This can be useful in situations where a function or operation encounters multiple errors, and it is necessary to return all of them to the caller for proper handling or logging.\n\nThe `JoinErrors` function takes two arguments: a `parentError` of type `error`, and a variadic parameter `errs` which is a slice of errors. The variadic parameter allows the function to accept any number of error arguments.\n\nInside the function, a new error called `fullError` is created using the `fmt.Errorf` function. The `parentError` is wrapped with a message \"errors: %w\" using the `%w` verb, which is a placeholder for the error argument. This verb is used to wrap errors so that they can be unwrapped later using the `errors.Unwrap` function.\n\nNext, the function iterates through the `errs` slice using a `for` loop. For each error in the slice, the `fullError` is updated by wrapping the current error using the `%w` verb. This creates a chain of wrapped errors, with each error wrapping the previous one.\n\nFinally, the `fullError` is returned to the caller. This error now contains all the input errors wrapped together, allowing the caller to handle or log them as needed.\n\nHere's an example of how the `JoinErrors` function might be used in the larger project:\n\n```go\nfunc performOperations() error {\n    err1 := operation1()\n    err2 := operation2()\n    err3 := operation3()\n\n    if err1 != nil || err2 != nil || err3 != nil {\n        return utils.JoinErrors(errors.New(\"operation errors\"), err1, err2, err3)\n    }\n\n    return nil\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, if any of the operations return an error, the `JoinErrors` function is called to combine all the errors into a single error, which is then returned to the caller.",
      "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `JoinErrors` function?\n   **Answer:** The `JoinErrors` function is used to combine multiple errors into a single error, with the `parentError` being the main error and the rest of the errors being appended to it.\n\n2. **Question:** Why is there a TODO comment about switching to `errors.Join` when bumping to Golang 1.20?\n   **Answer:** The TODO comment suggests that the current implementation of `JoinErrors` might be replaced with the `errors.Join` function when the project upgrades to Golang 1.20, as it might provide a more efficient or idiomatic way to join errors.\n\n3. **Question:** How does the current implementation of `JoinErrors` handle the case when multiple errors are passed in the `errs` parameter?\n   **Answer:** The current implementation iterates through the `errs` parameter and appends each error to the `fullError` variable using the `%w` verb in `fmt.Errorf`. However, it seems to overwrite the `fullError` in each iteration, which might not be the intended behavior for joining multiple errors."

The second function returns the converted value and panics if an overflow occurs.\n\nThese utility functions can be used throughout the duality project to perform common mathematical operations and conversions, ensuring consistency and reducing the need for repetitive code.

      "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `BasePrice` function and what does it return?\n   **Answer:** The `BasePrice` function returns the base value for price, which is 1.0001. It is used to provide a constant value for price calculations in the duality project.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `Uint64ToSortableString` function work and what is its use case?\n   **Answer:** The `Uint64ToSortableString` function converts a uint64 integer to a string that sorts lexicographically in integer order. This can be useful when you need to store or compare uint64 values as strings while maintaining their numerical order.\n\n3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `SafeUint64` and `MustSafeUint64` functions, and how do they handle overflow situations?\n   **Answer:** The `SafeUint64` function attempts to safely cast a uint64 value to an int64 value, returning the result and a boolean indicating if an overflow occurred. The `MustSafeUint64` function does the same, but instead of returning a boolean, it panics if an overflow occurs. These functions are used to handle situations where casting between uint64 and int64 types is necessary while ensuring that overflow errors are properly handled."
