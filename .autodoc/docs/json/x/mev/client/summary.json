This file contains a function called `GetQueryCmd` that returns a Cobra command for querying the duality project's MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) module. \n\nThe `GetQueryCmd` function takes a string as an argument, but it is not used in the function. The function creates a new Cobra command and sets its `Use` field to the `ModuleName` field of the `types` package in the duality project. The `ModuleName` field is a constant string that represents the name of the MEV module. \n\nThe `Short` field of the Cobra command is set to a formatted string that describes the purpose of the command. The purpose of the command is to provide querying commands for the MEV module. \n\nThe `DisableFlagParsing` field is set to `true`, which disables the parsing of flags for the command. The `SuggestionsMinimumDistance` field is set to `2`, which specifies the minimum distance for suggestions when a user enters an incorrect command. \n\nThe `RunE` field is set to `client.ValidateCmd`, which is a function that validates the command before it is executed. \n\nThe `CmdQueryParams` function is called and its returned value is added as a subcommand to the Cobra command. The `CmdQueryParams` function is not defined in this file, but it is likely defined in another file in the MEV module. \n\nThis code is used to create a command-line interface (CLI) for querying the MEV module in the duality project. The `GetQueryCmd` function is called by other parts of the duality project to create the CLI command for querying the MEV module. \n\nExample usage of the CLI command created by this code: \n\n```\ndualitycli query mev params\n```\n\nThis command queries the MEV module for its parameters.",

What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file is a part of the `duality` project and provides a function `GetQueryCmd` that returns the cli query commands for the `mev` module.\n\n2.
