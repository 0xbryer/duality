          "summary": "The code above defines two interfaces, `AccountKeeper` and `BankKeeper`, which are expected to be used in the duality project for simulations and retrieving account balances, respectively.\n\nThe `AccountKeeper` interface has one method, `GetAccount`, which takes in a `sdk.Context` and a `sdk.AccAddress` and returns an `types.AccountI`. This method is used to retrieve an account from the state based on its address. The `AccountKeeper` interface also includes a comment indicating that any methods imported from the `account` package should be defined here.\n\nThe `BankKeeper` interface has two methods, `SpendableCoins` and `SendCoinsFromAccountToModule`. The `SpendableCoins` method takes in a `sdk.Context` and a `sdk.AccAddress` and returns a `sdk.Coins` object representing the spendable balance of the account at the given address. The `SendCoinsFromAccountToModule` method takes in a `sdk.Context`, a `sdk.AccAddress` representing the sender, a string representing the recipient module, and a `sdk.Coins` object representing the amount to be sent. This method is used to send coins from an account to a module account. The `BankKeeper` interface also includes a comment indicating that any methods imported from the `bank` package should be defined here.\n\nOverall, these interfaces define the expected behavior of the account and bank keepers in the duality project. By defining these interfaces, the project can use different implementations of the account and bank keepers for different purposes, such as testing and production. For example, a mock implementation of the `AccountKeeper` interface could be used for testing, while a real implementation could be used in production. \n\nHere is an example of how these interfaces might be used in the duality project:\n\n```go\npackage mymodule\n\nimport (\n    \"github.com/myuser/duality/types\"\n)\n\ntype MyModule struct {\n    accountKeeper types.AccountKeeper\n    bankKeeper types.BankKeeper\n}\n\nfunc NewMyModule(accountKeeper types.AccountKeeper, bankKeeper types.BankKeeper) *MyModule {\n    return &MyModule{\n        accountKeeper: accountKeeper,\n        bankKeeper: bankKeeper,\n    }\n}\n\nfunc (m *MyModule) DoSomething(ctx sdk.Context, senderAddr sdk.AccAddress, recipientModule string, amt sdk.Coins) error {\n    // Get the sender's account\n    senderAcc := m.accountKeeper.GetAccount(ctx, senderAddr)\n\n    // Check if the sender has enough coins to send\n    spendableCoins := m.bankKeeper.SpendableCoins(ctx, senderAddr)\n    if !amt.IsAllLTE(spendableCoins) {\n        return errors.New(\"sender does not have enough coins to send\")\n    }\n\n    // Send coins from the sender's account to the recipient module\n    err := m.bankKeeper.SendCoinsFromAccountToModule(ctx, senderAddr, recipientModule, amt)\n    if err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n\n    // Do something else with the sender's account or the recipient module\n\n    return nil\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyModule` is a module in the duality project that needs to interact with the account and bank keepers. The `NewMyModule` function takes in implementations of the `AccountKeeper` and `BankKeeper` interfaces and returns a new instance of `MyModule`. The `DoSomething` method takes in a `sdk.Context`, a sender address, a recipient module name, and an amount of coins to send. It uses the `AccountKeeper` and `BankKeeper` implementations to retrieve the sender's account, check if they have enough coins to send, and send coins to the recipient module. This is just one example of how these interfaces might be used in the duality project.",

What is the significance of the `noalias` comment in the `AccountKeeper` interface definition?\n- The `noalias` comment indicates that the implementation of the `AccountKeeper` interface should not hold any references to the input arguments after the method returns."
