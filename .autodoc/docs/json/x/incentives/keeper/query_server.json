  "summary": "The `keeper` package contains the implementation of the QueryServer struct, which provides gRPC method handlers for the incentives module keeper. The QueryServer struct wraps around the incentives module keeper and provides methods to query the status of the module, gauges, stakes, and future reward estimates.\n\nThe `GetModuleStatus` method returns the reward coins, staked coins, and parameters of the incentives module. The `GetGaugeByID` method returns the gauge with the given ID. The `GetGauges` method returns a list of gauges filtered by status, denomination, and pagination. The `GetStakeByID` method returns the stake with the given ID. The `GetStakes` method returns a list of stakes for a given owner. The `GetFutureRewardEstimate` method returns an estimate of the future rewards for a given owner and stakes.\n\nThe `filterByPrefixAndDenom` method filters gauges based on a given key prefix and denomination. The method takes a context, key prefix, denomination, and pagination as input parameters. It returns a page response, a list of gauges, and an error. The method filters the gauges based on the denomination and key prefix. If the denomination is not empty, the method filters the gauges based on the denomination and the tick range. If the denomination is empty, the method returns all gauges.\n\nThe `getGaugeFromIDJsonBytes` method returns gauges from the JSON bytes of gauge IDs. The method takes a context and a byte array as input parameters. It returns a list of gauges and an error. The method unmarshals the byte array into a list of gauge IDs and retrieves the gauges with the given IDs.\n\nThe QueryServer struct is created by calling the `NewQueryServer` function, which takes a keeper as an input parameter. The keeper is an instance of the incentives module keeper. The QueryServer struct implements the `types.QueryServer` interface, which defines the gRPC methods for the incentives module.\n\nOverall, the QueryServer struct provides a set of methods to query the status of the incentives module, gauges, stakes, and future reward estimates. These methods can be used by other modules in the duality project to interact with the incentives module.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `duality` project and how does this code file fit into it?\n- The code file is a part of the `keeper` package in the `duality` project, which suggests that it is related to the storage and management of data within the project. However, more information is needed to determine the overall purpose of the project.\n\n2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `GetFutureRewardEstimate` function?\n- The `GetFutureRewardEstimate` function takes in a request object that includes an owner address and a list of stake IDs, as well as an end epoch value. It returns a response object that includes an estimate of the future rewards for the specified owner and stakes.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `filterByPrefixAndDenom` function and how does it work?\n- The `filterByPrefixAndDenom` function filters gauges based on a given key prefix and denom. It works by retrieving gauges from the store that match the prefix and then filtering them based on the denom value. The function returns a page response object and a list of gauges that match the filter criteria."
