  "summary": "The `types` package contains the `Stakes` type, which is a slice of pointers to `Stake` objects. This type has two methods: `CoinsByQueryCondition` and `GetCoins`.\n\nThe `CoinsByQueryCondition` method takes a `QueryCondition` object as an argument and returns a `sdk.Coins` object. It iterates over each `Stake` in the `Stakes` slice and calls the `CoinsPassingQueryCondition` method on each `Stake` object, passing in the `QueryCondition` argument. If the resulting `Coins` object is not empty, it is added to the `coins` variable. Finally, the `coins` variable is returned.\n\nThe `GetCoins` method returns a `sdk.Coins` object. It iterates over each `Stake` in the `Stakes` slice and calls the `GetCoins` method on each `Stake` object. If the resulting `Coins` object is not empty, it is added to the `coins` variable. Finally, the `coins` variable is returned.\n\nThese methods are likely used in the larger project to calculate the total amount of coins held by a group of stakeholders. The `CoinsByQueryCondition` method allows for filtering of the stakeholders based on a specific condition, while the `GetCoins` method returns the total amount of coins held by all stakeholders. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n// create a slice of Stake objects\nstakes := []*Stake{\n    &Stake{Coins: sdk.NewCoins(sdk.NewCoin(\"atom\", sdk.NewInt(100)))},\n    &Stake{Coins: sdk.NewCoins(sdk.NewCoin(\"atom\", sdk.NewInt(50)))},\n    &Stake{Coins: sdk.NewCoins(sdk.NewCoin(\"eth\", sdk.NewInt(200)))},\n}\n\n// calculate the total amount of atom coins held by all stakeholders\ntotalAtomCoins := stakes.GetCoins().AmountOf(\"atom\")\n\n// calculate the total amount of atom coins held by stakeholders passing a specific query condition\ndistrTo := QueryCondition{...}\nfilteredAtomCoins := stakes.CoinsByQueryCondition(distrTo).AmountOf(\"atom\")\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Stake` type and how is it used in this code?\n   - The `Stake` type is not defined in this code, but it is used as a pointer in the `Stakes` type. It is likely defined elsewhere in the `duality` project and is used to represent a stake in some context.\n2. What is the `CoinsByQueryCondition` method doing and how is it used?\n   - The `CoinsByQueryCondition` method takes a `QueryCondition` argument and returns a `sdk.Coins` object. It iterates through a slice of `Stake` pointers and adds up the coins that pass the query condition. It is likely used to calculate the total amount of coins that should be distributed to stakeholders based on some condition.\n3. What is the difference between the `CoinsByQueryCondition` and `GetCoins` methods?\n   - The `CoinsByQueryCondition` method takes a query condition as an argument and returns the coins that pass that condition, while the `GetCoins` method simply returns all the coins associated with the stakes. The `CoinsByQueryCondition` method is more specific and filters the coins based on a condition, while the `GetCoins` method returns all the coins regardless of any conditions."
