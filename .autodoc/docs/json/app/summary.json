      "summary": "The `NewAnteHandler` function in this code file is responsible for creating an AnteHandler for the duality project. An AnteHandler is a middleware that is used to validate transactions before they are processed by the blockchain. The AnteHandler is composed of a series of AnteDecorators, which are responsible for performing specific validation tasks.\n\nThe `NewAnteHandler` function takes in a `HandlerOptions` struct, which extends the SDK's AnteHandler options by requiring the IBC channel keeper. The function first checks that the required options are not nil, and returns an error if any of them are missing. It then sets up the signature gas consumer, which is used to consume gas for signature verification.\n\nThe function then creates an array of AnteDecorators, which are used to validate transactions. The AnteDecorators include:\n\n- `SetUpContextDecorator`: sets up the context for the transaction.\n- `RejectExtensionOptionsDecorator`: rejects transactions that contain unknown extension options.\n- `MsgFilterDecorator`: temporarily disabled so that the chain can be tested locally without the provider chain running.\n- `MempoolFeeDecorator`: validates that the transaction fee is sufficient for inclusion in the mempool.\n- `ValidateBasicDecorator`: validates the basic properties of the transaction.\n- `TxTimeoutHeightDecorator`: validates that the transaction timeout height is not too far in the future.\n- `ValidateMemoDecorator`: validates the memo field of the transaction.\n- `ConsumeGasForTxSizeDecorator`: consumes gas for the size of the transaction.\n- `DeductFeeDecorator`: deducts the transaction fee from the sender's account.\n- `SetPubKeyDecorator`: sets the public key for the transaction.\n- `ValidateSigCountDecorator`: validates the number of signatures on the transaction.\n- `SigGasConsumeDecorator`: consumes gas for signature verification.\n- `SigVerificationDecorator`: verifies the transaction signatures.\n- `IncrementSequenceDecorator`: increments the sequence number for the sender's account.\n- `ibcante.NewAnteDecorator`: adds IBC-specific validation.\n\nFinally, the function returns the AnteHandler created by chaining together the AnteDecorators.\n\nOverall, this code file is an important part of the duality project, as it provides the middleware for validating transactions before they are processed by the blockchain. The AnteHandler created by this code file ensures that transactions are valid and secure, and can be used to prevent malicious actors from exploiting vulnerabilities in the blockchain.",

What are the main steps in the AnteHandler pipeline defined in this code?\n    \n    The main steps in the AnteHandler pipeline defined in this code include setting up the context, rejecting extension options, filtering messages (temporarily disabled), validating basic transaction information, consuming gas for transaction size, deducting fees, verifying signatures, and incrementing the sequence number. It also includes IBC-specific steps such as verifying the channel and packet data."
