      "summary": "The code in this file is responsible for creating an EncodingConfig for a non-amino based test configuration in the duality project. The MakeTestEncodingConfig function is used internally in the SDK and should not be used by app users. Instead, app users should use the app.AppCodec.\n\nThe MakeTestEncodingConfig function creates a new legacy amino codec, a new interface registry, and a new proto codec. It then returns an EncodingConfig that contains the interface registry, marshaler, TxConfig, and amino codec. The TxConfig is created using the new proto codec and the default sign modes.\n\nThis function is used to create a test configuration for the duality project that does not use amino. Amino is a serialization protocol used in Cosmos SDK, and it is used to encode and decode data structures in the project. By creating a non-amino based test configuration, the developers can test the project's functionality without relying on amino.\n\nHere is an example of how this function might be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nimport (\n    \"github.com/duality/params\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    encodingConfig := params.MakeTestEncodingConfig()\n    // use encodingConfig to test project functionality\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the MakeTestEncodingConfig function is called to create an EncodingConfig for testing the project's functionality. The resulting encodingConfig can then be used to test the project without relying on amino.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this file within the `duality` project?\n- This file is located in the `params` package and contains a function for creating an encoding configuration for non-amino based tests.\n\n2. What is the difference between `codec` and `types` packages imported in this file?\n- The `codec` package is used for encoding and decoding data, while the `types` package is used for registering interfaces for use with the `codec` package.\n\n3. Why is the `MakeTestEncodingConfig` function marked as deprecated?\n- The function is marked as deprecated because app users should not create new codecs and should instead use the `AppCodec` provided by the app."

  "summary": "The `proto.go` file in the `params` folder is responsible for creating an `EncodingConfig` for a non-amino based test configuration in the duality project. This is important because it allows developers to test the project's functionality without relying on amino, a serialization protocol used in Cosmos SDK for encoding and decoding data structures.\n\nThe main function in this file is `MakeTestEncodingConfig()`, which is used internally in the SDK and should not be used by app users. Instead, app users should use the `app.AppCodec`. This function creates a new legacy amino codec, a new interface registry, and a new proto codec. It then returns an `EncodingConfig` that contains the interface registry, marshaler, TxConfig, and amino codec. The `TxConfig` is created using the new proto codec and the default sign modes.\n\nHere's an example of how this function might be used in the larger project:\n\n```go\nimport (\n    \"github.com/duality/params\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    encodingConfig := params.MakeTestEncodingConfig()\n    // use encodingConfig to test project functionality\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MakeTestEncodingConfig()` function is called to create an `EncodingConfig` for testing the project's functionality. The resulting `encodingConfig` can then be used to test the project without relying on amino.\n\nIn summary, the `proto.go` file in the `params` folder plays a crucial role in the duality project by providing a way to create a non-amino based test configuration. This allows developers to test the project's functionality without depending on amino, making it easier to identify potential issues and improve the overall quality of the project.",
