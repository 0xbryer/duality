  "summary": "The `osmocli` package contains code for a command-line interface (CLI) tool that interacts with an Osmocom cellular network. This specific file contains two functions: `IndexCmd` and `indexRunCmd`.\n\nThe `IndexCmd` function takes in a `moduleName` string and returns a `cobra.Command` object. This object represents a CLI command that can be executed by the user. The `Use` field of the command is set to the `moduleName` parameter, which is the name of the module being queried. The `Short` field is set to a formatted string that describes the purpose of the command. The `DisableFlagParsing` field is set to `true`, which means that any flags passed to the command will not be parsed. The `SuggestionsMinimumDistance` field is set to `2`, which means that the CLI will suggest commands that are at most two characters different from the user's input. Finally, the `RunE` field is set to the `indexRunCmd` function, which will be executed when the command is run.\n\nThe `indexRunCmd` function takes in a `cobra.Command` object and a slice of strings as arguments. It sets a custom usage template for the command using the `SetUsageTemplate` method of the `cmd` object. The template is a string that defines how the command's usage information will be displayed to the user. The function then calls the `Help` method of the `cmd` object, which prints the usage information to the console.\n\nOverall, this code defines a CLI command that can be used to query information about a specific module in an Osmocom cellular network. The `IndexCmd` function creates the command object, and the `indexRunCmd` function sets a custom usage template and prints the usage information to the console. This code can be used as a building block for a larger CLI tool that interacts with an Osmocom network. An example of how this code might be used is shown below:\n\n```\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"os\"\n\n\t\"github.com/spf13/cobra\"\n\t\"github.com/osmocom/duality/osmocli\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\trootCmd := &cobra.Command{\n\t\tUse: \"duality\",\n\t}\n\n\tmoduleCmd := osmocli.IndexCmd(\"module_name\")\n\trootCmd.AddCommand(moduleCmd)\n\n\tif err := rootCmd.Execute(); err != nil {\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, a root command is created with the name \"duality\". The `IndexCmd` function is called with the parameter \"module_name\", which creates a CLI command that can be used to query information about the \"module_name\" module. The `moduleCmd` object is added as a subcommand of the root command using the `AddCommand` method. Finally, the `Execute` method is called on the root command, which runs the CLI tool and waits for user input. When the user enters the `module_name` command, the `indexRunCmd` function is executed, which prints the usage information to the console.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `IndexCmd` function?\n- The `IndexCmd` function returns a `cobra.Command` that is used to query commands for a specific module.\n\n2. What is the significance of `DisableFlagParsing` being set to true?\n- Setting `DisableFlagParsing` to true disables the parsing of flags for the command, which means that any flags passed to the command will be ignored.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `usageTemplate` variable in the `indexRunCmd` function?\n- The `usageTemplate` variable is a string that defines the usage template for the command. It is used to generate the usage message that is displayed when the `--help` flag is passed to the command."
