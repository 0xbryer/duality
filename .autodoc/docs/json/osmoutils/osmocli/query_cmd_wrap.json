  "summary": "The `osmocli` package contains code that provides a command-line interface (CLI) for querying data from a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain. The code is written in Go and uses the Cobra library to create CLI commands.\n\nThe `QueryDescriptor` struct defines the properties of a query command, such as its name, description, and the function to call on the blockchain to retrieve the data. The `BuildQueryCli` function takes a `QueryDescriptor` and a function that creates a gRPC client for the blockchain and returns a Cobra command that can be used to execute the query. The `SimpleQueryCmd` function is a convenience function that creates a simple query command for the common case where all proto fields appear as arguments in order.\n\nThe `AddQueryCmd` function adds a query command to an existing Cobra command. It takes a `QueryDescriptor`, a function that creates a gRPC client for the blockchain, and a function that returns the request message to send to the blockchain. The `callQueryClientFn` function calls the specified function on the gRPC client with the request message and returns the response message.\n\nThe `GetParams` function returns a Cobra command that retrieves the parameters for a module on the blockchain. It takes the name of the module and a function that creates a gRPC client for the blockchain.\n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and extensible way to create query commands for a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain. It allows developers to define the properties of a query command and the function to call on the blockchain to retrieve the data, and provides a simple way to create and execute the command.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `QueryDescriptor` struct?\n- The `QueryDescriptor` struct is used to store information about a query command, such as its name, description, flags, and how to parse its arguments.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `BuildQueryCli` function?\n- The `BuildQueryCli` function is used to create a Cobra command for a query, based on a `QueryDescriptor` and a function that creates a gRPC client for the query.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `callQueryClientFn` function?\n- The `callQueryClientFn` function is used to call a method on a gRPC client for a query, based on the name of the method and a request message, and return the response message or an error."
