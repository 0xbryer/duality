      "summary": "The `osmoutils` package contains a function called `ApplyFuncIfNoError` and two helper functions called `IsOutOfGasError` and `PrintPanicRecoveryError`. \n\nThe `ApplyFuncIfNoError` function takes two arguments: a `sdk.Context` and a function `f` that takes a `sdk.Context` and returns an error. The purpose of this function is to execute the function `f` within a cache context. If there is an error or panic, the state machine change is dropped and the error is logged. If there is no error, the output of `f` is written to the cache context and the events are emitted. This function is useful for executing functions that modify the state of the application, such as transactions. \n\nThe `IsOutOfGasError` function takes an argument `err` of type `any` and returns a boolean and a string. This function is used to determine if an error is an out of gas error. If the error is an out of gas error, the function returns `true` and the error descriptor. If the error is not an out of gas error, the function returns `false` and an empty string. \n\nThe `PrintPanicRecoveryError` function takes two arguments: a `sdk.Context` and a `recoveryError` of type `interface{}`. The purpose of this function is to log the recovery error and the stack trace. If the recovery error is an out of gas error, the error is logged as a debug message. If the recovery error is a string, runtime error, or error, the error is logged as an error message. If the recovery error is of any other type, the error is logged as a default panic message and the stack trace is printed to stdout. \n\nOverall, these functions are used to handle errors and panics that may occur during the execution of functions that modify the state of the application. The `ApplyFuncIfNoError` function provides a way to execute these functions within a cache context and handle any errors or panics that may occur.

      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ApplyFuncIfNoError` function?\n- The `ApplyFuncIfNoError` function allows a function `f` to be executed within a new cache context, and if there is no error, the output of `f` is written to the state machine. If there is an error or panic, the state machine change is dropped and the error is logged.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `IsOutOfGasError` function?\n- The `IsOutOfGasError` function checks if an error is an out of gas error, and returns a boolean indicating whether it is, as well as a string descriptor of the error.\n\n3. What does the `PrintPanicRecoveryError` function do?\n- The `PrintPanicRecoveryError` function logs the recovery error and stack trace if it can be parsed, and emits them to stdout if not.

It creates a `sdk.Coins` object with a denomination and amount of 10 and returns a string with the `--fees` flag and the string representation of the `sdk.Coins` object.\n\nThe `ParseUint64SliceFromString` function takes a string and a separator and returns a slice of `uint64` values parsed from the string. It splits the string into substrings using the separator, trims whitespace from each substring, and parses it as a base-10 unsigned integer with a bit length of 64. It returns an error if any substring cannot be parsed.\n\nThe `ParseSdkIntFromString` function is similar to `ParseUint64SliceFromString`, but it returns a slice of `sdk.Int` values instead of `uint64` values.\n\nThe `ParseSdkDecFromString` function is also similar, but it returns a slice of `sdk.Dec` values parsed from a string.\n\nThe `CreateRandomAccounts` function generates a slice of `sdk.AccAddress` objects with random public keys. It takes an integer argument `numAccts` that specifies the number of addresses to generate. It uses the `ed25519` package from Tendermint to generate a random private key, gets the public key from the private key, and creates an `sdk.AccAddress` object from the public key.\n\nThese functions are likely used throughout the `duality` project to parse user input, create transaction fees, and generate test data. For example, `ParseSdkIntFromString` might be used to parse weights for a weighted random selection algorithm, and `CreateRandomAccounts` might be used to generate test accounts for a simulation.",

The purpose of this function is to provide a way to create new instances of any type, including pointers to structs. \n\nThe function first creates a variable `v` of type `T`. It then uses reflection to determine if `T` is a pointer or not. If `T` is a pointer, the function creates a new instance of the underlying struct using reflection, and then returns a pointer to it. If `T` is not a pointer, the function allocates memory for a new instance of `T` using the `new` keyword and returns it.\n\nThis function can be useful in a variety of scenarios where dynamic creation of new instances of a type is required. For example, it could be used in a factory pattern to create new objects of different types based on some input. \n\nHere is an example of how `MakeNew` could be used to create a new instance of a struct:\n\n```\ntype Person struct {\n    Name string\n    Age int\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    p := MakeNew[Person]()\n    p.Name = \"John\"\n    p.Age = 30\n    fmt.Println(p) // prints \"{John 30}\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `MakeNew` is used to create a new instance of the `Person` struct.

The code in this file defines several types and functions that are used to parse and handle command-line flags.\n\nThe `FlagAdvice` type is a struct that contains advice on how to handle command-line flags. It has several fields that are used to customize the behavior of the CLI. For example, the `HasPagination` field is a boolean that indicates whether the CLI should paginate its output. The `CustomFlagOverrides` field is a map that allows users to override the default flag names with custom names. The `CustomFieldParsers` field is a map that allows users to define custom parsers for command-line flags.\n\nThe `FlagDesc` type is a struct that describes the flags that should be added to a command. It has two fields: `RequiredFlags` and `OptionalFlags`. These fields are arrays of `pflag.FlagSet` objects, which represent sets of command-line flags.\n\nThe `AddFlags` function takes a `cobra.Command` object and a `FlagDesc` object as arguments. It adds the flags described in the `FlagDesc` object to the `cobra.Command` object.

This specific file contains two functions: `IndexCmd` and `indexRunCmd`.\n\nThe `IndexCmd` function takes in a `moduleName` string and returns a `cobra.Command` object. This object represents a CLI command that can be executed by the user. The `Use` field of the command is set to the `moduleName` parameter, which is the name of the module being queried. The `Short` field is set to a formatted string that describes the purpose of the command. The `DisableFlagParsing` field is set to `true`, which means that any flags passed to the command will not be parsed. The `SuggestionsMinimumDistance` field is set to `2`, which means that the CLI will suggest commands that are at most two characters different from the user's input. Finally, the `RunE` field is set to the `indexRunCmd` function, which will be executed when the command is run.\n\nThe `indexRunCmd` function takes in a `cobra.Command` object and a slice of strings as arguments. It sets a custom usage template for the command using the `SetUsageTemplate` method of the `cmd` object. The template is a string that defines how the command's usage information will be displayed to the user. The function then calls the `Help` method of the `cmd` object, which prints the usage information to the console.\n\nOverall, this code defines a CLI command that can be used to query information about a specific module in an Osmocom cellular network. The `IndexCmd` function creates the command object, and the `indexRunCmd` function sets a custom usage template and prints the usage information to the console. This code can be used as a building block for a larger CLI tool that interacts with an Osmocom network. An example of how this code might be used is shown below:\n\n```\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"os\"\n\n\t\"github.com/spf13/cobra\"\n\t\"github.com/osmocom/duality/osmocli\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\trootCmd := &cobra.Command{\n\t\tUse: \"duality\",\n\t}\n\n\tmoduleCmd := osmocli.IndexCmd(\"module_name\")\n\trootCmd.AddCommand(moduleCmd)\n\n\tif err := rootCmd.Execute(); err != nil {\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, a root command is created with the name \"duality\". The `IndexCmd` function is called with the parameter \"module_name\", which creates a CLI command that can be used to query information about the \"module_name\" module. The `moduleCmd` object is added as a subcommand of the root command using the `AddCommand` method. Finally, the `Execute` method is called on the root command, which runs the CLI tool and waits for user input. When the user enters the `module_name` command, the `indexRunCmd` function is executed, which prints the usage information to the console.",
          "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `IndexCmd` function?\n- The `IndexCmd` function returns a `cobra.Command` that is used to query commands for a specific module.\n\n2. What is the significance of `DisableFlagParsing` being set to true?\n- Setting `DisableFlagParsing` to true disables the parsing of flags for the command, which means that any flags passed to the command will be ignored.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `usageTemplate` variable in the `indexRunCmd` function?\n- The `usageTemplate` variable is a string that defines the usage template for the command. It is used to generate the usage message that is displayed when the `--help` flag is passed to the command."

The function creates a new instance of the `reqP` type, iterates over its fields, and attempts to parse each field from either an argument or a flag using the provided `FlagAdvice` and `pflag.FlagSet`. It returns the parsed `reqP` instance and an error if there was an issue in parsing any field.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `ParseField` function determine whether to parse a field from an argument or a flag?\n\n   **Answer:** The `ParseField` function first checks if there is a custom field parser provided in the `FlagAdvice`. If so, it uses the custom parser to parse the field. If not, it attempts to parse the field from a flag using the `ParseFieldFromFlag` function.

Here is an example of how this code might be used to build a transaction command:\n\n```\ndesc := &TxCliDesc{\n    Use: \"mytx\",\n    Short: \"My custom transaction command\",\n    Long: \"This command does something cool\",\n    NumArgs: 2,\n    ParseAndBuildMsg: func(clientCtx client.Context, args []string, flags *pflag.FlagSet) (sdk.Msg, error) {\n        // Parse arguments and build a message\n    },\n    TxSignerFieldName: \"from\",\n    Flags: FlagDesc{\n        {\"flag1\", \"\", \"Flag 1\", true},\n        {\"flag2\", \"\", \"Flag 2\", true},\n    },\n}\ncmd := desc.BuildCommandCustomFn()\n```",

What is the purpose of the `TxCliDesc` struct?\n- The `TxCliDesc` struct is used to describe a CLI command for a transaction message. It includes information such as the command name, description, number of arguments, and a function to parse and build the message.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `AddTxCmd` function?\n- The `AddTxCmd` function adds a new Cobra command to an existing command with the given transaction message and CLI description."

      "summary": "The `osmocli` package provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the Osmocom cellular network stack and a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain. It offers a flexible and extensible way to handle command-line flags, create query and transaction commands, and generate formatted long descriptions for CLI commands.\n\nThe `flag_advice.go` file defines types and functions for parsing and handling command-line flags. It allows users to customize the behavior of the CLI by defining custom flag names and parsers. For example:\n\n```go\nflagAdvice := osmocli.FlagAdvice{\n    HasPagination: true,\n    CustomFlagOverrides: map[string]string{\n        \"flag1\": \"custom_flag1\",\n    },\n    CustomFieldParsers: map[string]osmocli.CustomFieldParserFn{\n        \"field1\": osmocli.FlagOnlyParser(func() interface{} { return new(int) }),\n    },\n}\n```\n\nThe `index_cmd.go` file defines a CLI command that can be used to query information about a specific module in an Osmocom cellular network. Here's an example of how to create a root command and add a module command:\n\n```go\nrootCmd := &cobra.Command{Use: \"duality\"}\nmoduleCmd := osmocli.IndexCmd(\"module_name\")\nrootCmd.AddCommand(moduleCmd)\n```\n\nThe `parsers.go` file provides functionality for parsing command-line arguments and flags for the duality project. It uses reflection to dynamically parse the fields of a given struct based on the provided arguments and flags:\n\n```go\ntype MyStruct struct {\n    Name string\n    Age  int\n}\n\nflagAdvice := osmocli.FlagAdvice{}\nflags := pflag.NewFlagSet(\"my-command\", pflag.ContinueOnError)\nargs := []string{\"John\", \"25\"}\n\nparsedStruct, err := osmocli.ParseFieldsFromFlagsAndArgs[MyStruct](flagAdvice, flags, args)\n```\n\nThe `query_cmd_wrap.go` file provides a way to create query commands for a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain. It allows developers to define the properties of a query command and the function to call on the blockchain to retrieve the data:\n\n```go\nqueryDesc := osmocli.QueryDescriptor{\n    Name: \"myquery\",\n    Desc: \"My custom query command\",\n    QueryFn: func(clientCtx client.Context, req *myquery.Request) (*myquery.Response, error) {\n        // Call the blockchain to retrieve the data\n    },\n}\nqueryCmd := osmocli.BuildQueryCli(queryDesc, createGrpcClient)\n```\n\nThe `string_formatter.go` file generates long descriptions for CLI commands. Developers can use the `FormatLongDescDirect` function to generate a formatted long description string for a specific module:\n\n```go\nlongDesc := \"This command does something.\\n\\nUsage: {{.CommandPrefix}} command [args]\\n\\n{{.ExampleHeader}}\\n{{.CommandPrefix}} command arg1 arg2\"\nmoduleName := \"mymodule\"\nformattedLongDesc := osmocli.FormatLongDescDirect(longDesc, moduleName)\n```\n\nThe `tx_cmd_wrap.go` file provides a framework for building CLI commands for interacting with a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain. It allows developers to easily define the properties of a transaction command and build a Cobra command from those properties:\n\n```go\ndesc := &osmocli.TxCliDesc{\n    Use: \"mytx\",\n    Short: \"My custom transaction command\",\n    Long: \"This command does something cool\",\n    NumArgs: 2,\n    ParseAndBuildMsg: func(clientCtx client.Context, args []string, flags *pflag.FlagSet) (sdk.Msg, error) {\n        // Parse arguments and build a message\n    },\n    TxSignerFieldName: \"from\",\n    Flags: osmocli.FlagDesc{\n        {\"flag1\", \"\", \"Flag 1\", true},\n        {\"flag2\", \"\", \"Flag 2\", true},\n    },\n}\ncmd := desc.BuildCommandCustomFn()\n```",

  "summary": "The `osmoutils` package provides utility functions and error handling mechanisms for the `duality` project. It contains functions for executing state-modifying functions within a cache context, parsing and creating various data types, creating new instances of generic types, and manipulating and analyzing slices.\n\nFor example, the `ApplyFuncIfNoError` function in `cache_ctx.go` is used to execute a function `f` within a cache context. If there is an error or panic, the state machine change is dropped and the error is logged. This function is useful for executing functions that modify the state of the application, such as transactions.\n\n```go\nfunc someFunction(ctx sdk.Context) error {\n    // Modify the state of the application\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    ctx := sdk.Context{}\n    osmoutils.ApplyFuncIfNoError(ctx, someFunction)\n}\n```\n\nThe `osmocli` subfolder provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the Osmocom cellular network stack and a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain. It offers a flexible and extensible way to handle command-line flags, create query and transaction commands, and generate formatted long descriptions for CLI commands.\n\nFor example, the `BuildQueryCli` function in `query_cmd_wrap.go` can be used to create a query command for a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain:\n\n```go\nqueryDesc := osmocli.QueryDescriptor{\n    Name: \"myquery\",\n    Desc: \"My custom query command\",\n    QueryFn: func(clientCtx client.Context, req *myquery.Request) (*myquery.Response, error) {\n        // Call the blockchain to retrieve the data\n    },\n}\nqueryCmd := osmocli.BuildQueryCli(queryDesc, createGrpcClient)\n```\n\nThe utility functions in `slice_helper.go` can be used to manipulate and analyze slices of various types in the `duality` project. For example, the `SortSlice` function can be used to sort a slice of integers in ascending order:\n\n```go\nimport \"osmoutils\"\n\nnumbers := []int{3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3}\nosmoutils.SortSlice(numbers)\nfmt.Println(numbers) // Output: [1 1 2 3 3 4 5 5 6 9]\n```\n\nThese utility functions and CLI tools can be used throughout the `duality` project to handle errors, parse user input, create transaction fees, generate test data, and interact with the Osmocom cellular network stack and a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain.",
