  "summary": "This code is responsible for embedding a directory called \"static\" into the binary of the duality project. The `embed` package is used to achieve this. The `embed.FS` type is a file system that can be used to access the contents of the embedded directory. \n\nThe purpose of embedding the \"static\" directory is to make it easier to distribute the duality project. Instead of having to distribute the directory separately, it can be included in the binary itself. This makes it easier to deploy the project on different machines without having to worry about whether the \"static\" directory is present or not. \n\nThe `//go:embed` directive is a special comment that tells the Go compiler to include the specified files or directories in the binary. In this case, the `static` directory is being included. \n\nTo access the contents of the embedded directory, the `Docs` variable can be used. For example, if there is a file called \"index.html\" in the \"static\" directory, it can be accessed like this:\n\n```go\ndata, err := Docs.ReadFile(\"static/index.html\")\nif err != nil {\n    // handle error\n}\n// use data\n```\n\nThis code reads the contents of the \"index.html\" file into the `data` variable. If there is an error reading the file, it is handled appropriately. The `data` variable can then be used as needed. \n\nOverall, this code is an important part of the duality project because it allows the project to be distributed more easily. By embedding the \"static\" directory in the binary, the project can be deployed on different machines without having to worry about whether the directory is present or not.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `embed` package being imported?\n   \n   The `embed` package is being used to embed static files into the binary.\n\n2. What is the `static` directory being embedded?\n   \n   The `static` directory is being embedded into the binary, which likely contains static files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.\n\n3. How can the embedded files be accessed and used?\n   \n   The embedded files can be accessed and used through the `Docs` variable, which is of type `embed.FS`. This variable can be used to read and serve the embedded files."
